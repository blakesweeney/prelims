# Energy Storage in Molecular Machines #

> Like macroscopic machines, molecular machines are made of modular parts that
> have specific functions and that undergo characteristic motions. We will address
> this aspect of molecular machines after you look at some movies. Macroscopic
> machines have components for conserving momentum and using it to move between
> states that generate power (“power strokes”). An example is the flywheel in a
> car engine. After you do calculations on frictional forces, reflect on whether
> you expect to find components that behave like flywheels in nano-scale machines.
