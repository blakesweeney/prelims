abstract = {Hepatitis delta virus ribozyme folds into a tightly packed tertiary structure. However, unlike other ribozymes, it does not appear to be able to follow alternative folding pathways. Molecular engineering of the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme led to the development of a ribozyme possessing an endoribonuclease activity that is under the control of a G-quadruplex structure (i.e., a G-quartzyme). This latter species represents an entirely new class of ribozyme. Mutants of this ribozyme were then generated in order to shed light on the modulation of the cleavage activity caused by the presence of the G-quadruplex structure. Kinetic characterization of the G-quartzyme was performed under various single turnover conditions. It was found to be active only in the presence of potassium cations that act as counter ions in the positioning of the four coplanar guanines that form the building block of the G-quadruplex structure. The G-quartzyme behaves as an allosteric ribozyme, with the potassium cations acting as positive effectors with a Hill coefficient of 2.9 +/- 0.2. The conformation transition caused by the presence of the potassium ions is supported by enzymatic and chemical probing of both the inactive (off) and active (on) structures. This study shows that it is possible to interfere with the tight structure of the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme by adding an unusual, stable structure. To our knowledge, the G-quartzyme is the sole ribozyme that exhibits a monovalent cation-dependent activity.},

@article{Lambert2009,
abstract = {Many RNA tertiary structures are stable in the presence of monovalent ions alone. To evaluate the degree to which ions at or near the surfaces of such RNAs contribute to stability, the salt-dependent stability of a variety of RNA structures was measured with each of the five group I cations. The stability of hairpin secondary structures and a pseudoknot tertiary structure are insensitive to the ion identity, but the tertiary structures of two other RNAs, an adenine riboswitch and a kissing loop complex, become more stable by 2-3 kcal/mol as ion size decreases. This "default" trend is attributed to the ability of smaller ions to approach the RNA surface more closely. The degree of cation accumulation around the kissing loop complex was also inversely proportional to ion radius, perhaps because of the presence of sterically restricted pockets that can be accessed only by smaller ions. An RNA containing the tetraloop-receptor motif shows a strong (up to approximately 3 kcal/mol) preference for Na(+) or K(+) over other group I ions, consistent with the chelation of K(+) by this motif in some crystal structures. This RNA reverts to the default dependence on ion size when a base forming part of the chelation site is mutated. Lastly, an RNA aptamer for cobinamide, which was originally selected in the presence of high concentrations of LiCl, binds ligand more strongly in the presence of Li(+) than other monovalent ions. On the basis of these trends in RNA stability with group I ion size, it is argued that two features of RNA tertiary structures may promote strong interactions with ions at or near the RNA surface: negative charge densities that are higher than that in secondary structures, and the occasional presence of chelation sites, which are electronegative pockets that selectively bind ions of an optimum size.},

abstract = {Studying the cell cycle process is crucial for understanding cell growth, proliferation, development, and death. We uncovered some key factors in determining the global robustness and function of the budding yeast cell cycle by exploring the underlying landscape and flux of this nonequilibrium network. The dynamics of the system is determined by both the landscape which attracts the system down to the oscillation orbit and the curl flux which drives the periodic motion on the ring. This global structure of landscape is crucial for the coherent cell cycle dynamics and function. The topography of the underlying landscape, specifically the barrier height separating basins of attractions, characterizes the capability of changing from one part of the system to another. This quantifies the stability and robustness of the system. We studied how barrier height is influenced by environmental fluctuations and perturbations on specific wirings of the cell cycle network. When the fluctuations increase, the barrier height decreases and the period and amplitude of cell cycle oscillation is more dispersed and less coherent. The corresponding dissipation of the system quantitatively measured by the entropy production rate increases. This implies that the system is less stable under fluctuations. We identified some key structural elements for wirings of the cell cycle network responsible for the change of the barrier height and therefore the global stability of the system through the sensitivity analysis. The results are in agreement with recent experiments and also provide new predictions.},

@article{Crosby2012,
abstract = {N-lysine acetylation is a posttranslational modification that has been well studied in eukaryotes and is likely widespread in prokaryotes as well. The central metabolic enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase is regulated in both bacteria and eukaryotes by acetylation of a conserved lysine residue in the active site. In the purple photosynthetic $\alpha$-proteobacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris, two protein acetyltransferases (RpPat and the newly identified RpKatA) and two deacetylases (RpLdaA and RpSrtN) regulate the activities of AMP-forming acyl-CoA synthetases. In this work, we used LC/MS/MS to identify other proteins regulated by the N-lysine acetylation/deacetylation system of this bacterium. Of the 24 putative acetylated proteins identified, 14 were identified more often in a strain lacking both deacetylases. Nine of these proteins were members of the AMP-forming acyl-CoA synthetase family. RpPat acetylated all nine of the acyl-CoA synthetases identified by this work, and RpLdaA deacetylated eight of them. In all cases, acetylation occurred at the conserved lysine residue in the active site, and acetylation decreased activity of the enzymes by >70\%. Our results show that many different AMP-forming acyl-CoA synthetases are regulated by N-lysine acetylation. Five non-acyl-CoA synthetases were identified as possibly acetylated, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and Rpa1177, a putative 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase. Neither RpPat nor RpKatA acetylated either of these proteins in vitro. It has been reported that Salmonella enterica Pat (SePat) can acetylate a number of metabolic enzymes, including GAPDH, but we were unable to confirm this claim, suggesting that the substrate range of SePat is not as broad as suggested previously.},

Profiling of the miRNome (global miRNA expression levels) has become prevalent, and abundant miRNome data are currently available for various cancers. The pattern of miRNA expression can be correlated with cancer type, stage, and other clinical variables, so miRNA profiling can be used as a tool for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. miRNA expression analyses also suggest oncogenic (or tumor-suppressive) roles of miRNAs. miRNAs play roles in almost all aspects of cancer biology, such as proliferation, apoptosis, invasion/metastasis, and angiogenesis. Given that many miRNAs are deregulated in cancers but have not yet been further studied, it is expected that more miRNAs will emerge as players in the etiology and progression of cancer. Here we also discuss miRNAs as a tool for cancer therapy.},

@article{Guzman-Vargas2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TF) and regulated genes (RG) in a species genome can be lumped together in a single directed graph. The TF's and RG's conform the nodes of this graph, while links are drawn whenever a transcription factor regulates a gene's expression. Projections onto TF nodes can be constructed by linking every two nodes regulating a common gene. Similarly, projections onto RG nodes can be made by linking every two regulated genes sharing at least one common regulator. Recent studies of the connectivity pattern in the transcription-factor regulatory network of many organisms have revealed some interesting properties. However, the differences between TF and RG nodes have not been widely explored. RESULTS: After analysing the RG and TF projections of the transcription-factor gene regulatory networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we found several common characteristic as well as some noticeable differences. To better understand these differences, we compared the properties of the E. coli and S. cerevisiae RG- and TF-projected networks with those of the corresponding projections built from randomized versions of the original bipartite networks. These last results indicate that the observed differences are mostly due to the very different ratios of TF to RG counts of the E. coli and S. cerevisiae bipartite networks, rather than to their having different connectivity patterns. CONCLUSION: Since E. coli is a prokaryotic organism while S. cerevisiae is eukaryotic, there are important differences between them concerning processing of mRNA before translation, DNA packing, amount of junk DNA, and gene regulation. From the results in this paper we conclude that the most important effect such differences have had on the development of the corresponding transcription-factor gene regulatory networks is their very different ratios of TF to RG numbers. This ratio is more than three times larger in S. cerevisiae than in E. coli. Our calculations reveal that, both species' gene regulatory networks have very similar connectivity patterns, despite their very different TF to RG ratios. An this, to our consideration, indicates that the structure of both networks is optimal from an evolutionary viewpoint.},

@article{Iwakiri2012,
abstract = {Protein-RNA interactions are essential for many biological processes. However, the structural mechanisms underlying these interactions are not fully understood. Here, we analyzed the protein surface shape (dented, intermediate or protruded) and the RNA base pairing properties (paired or unpaired nucleotides) at the interfaces of 91 protein-RNA complexes derived from the Protein Data Bank. Dented protein surfaces prefer unpaired nucleotides to paired ones at the interface, and hydrogen bonds frequently occur between the protein backbone and RNA bases. In contrast, protruded protein surfaces do not show such a preference, rather, electrostatic interactions initiate the formation of hydrogen bonds between positively charged amino acids and RNA phosphate groups. Interestingly, in many protein-RNA complexes that interact via an RNA loop, an aspartic acid is favored at the interface. Moreover, in most of these complexes, nucleotide bases in the RNA loop are flipped out and form hydrogen bonds with the protein, which suggests that aspartic acid is important for RNA loop recognition through a base-flipping process. This study provides fundamental insights into the role of the shape of the protein surface and RNA secondary structures in mediating protein-RNA interactions.},

This has led to speculation that non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) might be as important as proteins in the regulation of vital cellular functions. However, there has been significantly less progress in actually demonstrating the functions of these transcripts. In this article, we review the results of recent experiments that show that transcription of non-protein-coding RNA is far more widespread than was previously anticipated. Although some ncRNAs act as molecular switches that regulate gene expression, the function of many ncRNAs is unknown. New experimental and computational approaches are emerging that will help determine whether these newly identified transcription products are evidence of important new biochemical pathways or are merely 'junk' RNA generated by the cell as a by-product of its functional activities.},

abstract = {Previously, a psychrophilic rod-shaped marine bacterium (strain HAW-EB3(T)) isolated from Halifax Harbour sediment was noted for its ability to degrade hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). In the present study phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic characterization showed that strain HAW-EB3(T) represents a novel species of Shewanella. Strain HAW-EB3(T) contained lysine decarboxylase, which is absent in other known Shewanella species, and distinguished itself from most other species of Shewanella by the presence of arginine dehydrolase, ornithine decarboxylase and chitinase, and by its ability to oxidize and ferment N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. Strain HAW-EB3(T) grew on several carbon sources (N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, Tween 40, Tween 80, acetate, succinate, butyrate and serine) and showed distinctive fatty acid and quinone compositions. Both phenotypic and 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic cluster analyses demonstrated that HAW-EB3(T) belongs to the Na(+)-requiring group of Shewanella species. The HAW-EB3(T) 16S rRNA gene sequence displayed < or =97.4 \% similarity to all known Shewanella species and was most similar to those of two bioluminescent species, Shewanella hanedai and Shewanella woodyi. However, gyrB of strain HAW-EB3(T) was significantly different from those of other Shewanella species, with similarities less than 85 \%. DNA-DNA hybridization showed that its genomic DNA was less than 25 \% related to that of S. hanedai or S. woodyi. Therefore we propose Shewanella sediminis sp. nov., with HAW-EB3(T) (=NCIMB 14036(T)=DSM 17055(T)) as the type strain.},

abstract = {We report a rational approach to the construction of cross-reactive arrays for steroids consisting of five to seven sensors incorporating modified oligonucleotides. The sensors for our arrays were selected to maximize their differential responses to the two steroids most different in an arbitrarily chosen parameter named "shape-length". The arrays incorporated three previously unreported types of sensors identified through a massive screening effort: (1) three-way junction sensors with neutralized charges within junction; (2) "self-aggregating sensors"; and (3) sensors incorporating fluorophore directly in a three-way junction as a spacer. The arrays were tested on seven steroids and an alkaloid (cocaine) over a range of concentrations, and achieved 92-96\% accuracy in class assignments, despite the close structural similarities between steroids.},

abstract = {Processive transcription antitermination requires the assembly of the complete antitermination complex, which is initiated by the formation of the ternary NusB-NusE-BoxA RNA complex. We have elucidated the crystal structure of this complex, demonstrating that the BoxA RNA is composed of 8 nt that are recognized by the NusB-NusE heterodimer. Functional biologic and biophysical data support the structural observations and establish the relative significance of key protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Further crystallographic investigation of a NusB-NusE-dsRNA complex reveals a heretofore unobserved dsRNA binding site contiguous with the BoxA binding site. We propose that the observed dsRNA represents BoxB RNA, as both single-stranded BoxA and double-stranded BoxB components are present in the classical lambda antitermination site. Combining these data with known interactions amongst antitermination factors suggests a specific model for the assembly of the complete antitermination complex.},

@article{Homouz2008,
abstract = {How the crowded environment inside cells affects the structures of proteins with aspherical shapes is a vital question because many proteins and protein-protein complexes in vivo adopt anisotropic shapes. Here we address this question by combining computational and experimental studies of a football-shaped protein (i.e., Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE) in crowded, cell-like conditions. The results show that macromolecular crowding affects protein-folding dynamics as well as overall protein shape. In crowded milieus, distinct conformational changes in VlsE are accompanied by secondary structure alterations that lead to exposure of a hidden antigenic region. Our work demonstrates the malleability of "native" proteins and implies that crowding-induced shape changes may be important for protein function and malfunction in vivo.},

abstract = {Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are receiving more and more attention not only as an abundant class of genes, but also as regulatory structural elements (some located in mRNAs). A key feature of RNA function is its structure. Computational methods were developed early for folding and prediction of RNA structure with the aim of assisting in functional analysis. With the discovery of more and more ncRNAs, it has become clear that a large fraction of these are highly structured. Interestingly, a large part of the structure is comprised of regular Watson-Crick and GU wobble base pairs. This and the increased amount of available genomes have made it possible to employ structure-based methods for genomic screens. The field has moved from folding prediction of single sequences to computational screens for ncRNAs in genomic sequence using the RNA structure as the main characteristic feature. Whereas early methods focused on energy-directed folding of single sequences, comparative analysis based on structure preserving changes of base pairs has been efficient in improving accuracy, and today this constitutes a key component in genomic screens. Here, we cover the basic principles of RNA folding and touch upon some of the concepts in current methods that have been applied in genomic screens for de novo RNA structures in searches for novel ncRNA genes and regulatory RNA structure on mRNAs. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the different strategies and how they can complement each other.},

The amount of FIS protein is subject to dramatic changes during growth. We demonstrate that fis is part of an operon with one ORF of unknown function preceding the fis gene. Regulation of fis synthesis occurs at the transcriptional level. Within 15 min after nutritional upshift a large burst of fis mRNA is produced which levels off when cells begin to grow. By mutational analysis using promoter-lacZ fusions we demonstrate that the fis promoter is autoregulated by FIS. Growth phase regulation of the fis promoter depends on the presence of a GC motif downstream of the -10 region. We show that the fis promoter is subject to stringent control and discuss this unusual feature with respect to the known and putative functions FIS serves in E. coli.},

abstract = {Prokaryotic genomes are contained in a cellular structure termed the nucleoid. However, despite a complete genome sequence and years of intensive study of Escherichia coli, our knowledge of nucleoid structure remains quite rudimentary. Moreover, little is known about the in vivo relationship between nucleoid structure and global gene regulation. Recent studies have shown that the structure of the nucleoid responds dynamically to changing environmental conditions and that this metastable nature of the nucleoid is mediated to a large extent by the distribution and activity of RNA polymerase (RNAP). For example, during rapid growth, the nucleoid is highly condensed with RNAP concentrated into transcription foci or factories, structures analogous to the eukaryotic nucleolus, where active transcription of rRNA genes occurs. However, during nutrient starvation and/or limitation, RNAP is redistributed throughout the genome and this is accompanied by a decondensation of the nucleoid. Thus, the distribution of RNAP, global gene regulation and the dynamic structure of the nucleoid are coupled in the bacterial cell.},

In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the biology of lncRNAs and propose avenues of investigation that may lead to fundamental new insights into their functions and mechanisms of action.

abstract = {The "Equilibrium Model" has provided new tools for describing and investigating enzyme thermal adaptation. It has been shown that the effect of temperature on enzyme activity is not only governed by deltaG(double dagger)(cat) and deltaG(double dagger)(inact) but also by two new intrinsic parameters, deltaH(eq) and T(eq), which describe the enthalpy and midpoint, respectively, of a reversible equilibrium between active and inactive (but not denatured) forms of enzyme. Twenty-one enzymes from organisms with a wide range of growth temperatures were characterized using the Equilibrium Model. Statistical analysis indicates that T(eq) is a better predictor of growth temperature than enzyme stability (deltaG(double dagger)(inact)). As expected from the Equilibrium Model, deltaH(eq) correlates with catalytic temperature tolerance of enzymes and thus can be declared the first intrinsic and quantitative measure of enzyme eurythermalism. Other findings shed light on the evolution of psychrophilic and thermophilic enzymes. The findings suggest that the description of the Equilibrium Model of the effect of temperature on enzyme activity applies to all enzymes regardless of their temperature origins and that its associated parameters, deltaH(eq) and T(eq), are intrinsic and necessary parameters for characterizing the thermal properties of enzymes and their temperature adaptation and evolution.},

Besides fundamental limits imposed by radiation damage, poor detectors and beam-induced sample movement have been shown to degrade attainable resolutions. A new generation of direct electron detectors may ameliorate both effects. Apart from exhibiting improved signal-to-noise performance, these cameras are also fast enough to follow particle movements during electron irradiation. Here, we assess the potentials of this technology for cryo-EM structure determination. Using a newly developed statistical movie processing approach to compensate for beam-induced movement, we show that ribosome reconstructions with unprecedented resolutions may be calculated from almost two orders of magnitude fewer particles than used previously. Therefore, this methodology may expand the scope of high-resolution cryo-EM to a broad range of biological specimens.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00461.001.},

abstract = {We propose and study a class-expansion/innovation/loss model of genome evolution taking into account biological roles of genes and their constituent domains. In our model, numbers of genes in different functional categories are coupled to each other. For example, an increase in the number of metabolic enzymes in a genome is usually accompanied by addition of new transcription factors regulating these enzymes. Such coupling can be thought of as a proportional 'recipe' for genome composition of the type 'a spoonful of sugar for each egg yolk'. The model jointly reproduces two known empirical laws: the distribution of family sizes and the non-linear scaling of the number of genes in certain functional categories (e.g. transcription factors) with genome size. In addition, it allows us to derive a novel relation between the exponents characterizing these two scaling laws, establishing a direct quantitative connection between evolutionary and functional categories. It predicts that functional categories that grow faster-than-linearly with genome size to be characterized by flatter-than-average family size distributions. This relation is confirmed by our bioinformatics analysis of prokaryotic genomes. This proves that the joint quantitative trends of functional and evolutionary classes can be understood in terms of evolutionary growth with proportional recipes.},

abstract = {The effect of sublethal hydrostatic pressure on the transcriptome of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis was determined using a shot-gun-microarray. Among the 750 spots that passed quality analysis 42 genes were induced, while six were repressed when cells were incubated at 45 MPa for 30 min. The nature of genes and their differential expression clearly indicate cellular efforts to counteract a decrease in translational capacity. The majority of high pressure affected genes were found to encode either translation factors (EF-G, EF-TU), ribosomal proteins (S2, L6, L11), genes changing translational accuracy or molecular chaperones (GroEL, ClpL). These data agree with previously reported effects observed in in vitro studies as well as with physiological and proteomic data. This study provides in vivo evidence to identify ribosomes and impaired translation among primary targets for high pressure treatment. The observed induction of heat as well as cold shock genes (e.g. hsp60, gyrA) may be explained as a result of high pressure affected protein synthesis.},

abstract = {Total microbial burden and diversity associated with commercial airliner cabin air was assessed by molecular methods in 125 air samples from the business-class sections of 16 domestic and international flights. Viable microbial burden within these cabin air parcels constituted only 1-10\% of the total microbial population and ranged from below detection limits to 1.2 x 10(4) cells m(-3) as determined with a validated ATP-based technology. Cultivable bacterial diversity was almost entirely limited to Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus and Bacillus. In contrast, cloning and sequencing 16S rRNA gene directly from the samples without cultivation indicated a significantly broader diversity, as sequences representing more than 100 species, and encompassing 12 classes of bacteria, were retrieved in varying abundance. Sequences of proteobacterial and Gram-positive lineage were retrieved most frequently (58\% and 31\% of all clone sequences, respectively), with Gram-positive and alpha-proteobacterial sequences dominating international flight samples and beta- and gamma-proteobacterial sequences comprising the largest portion of those retrieved from domestic flights. Significant differences in bacterial load and diversity were noted between samples obtained on domestic and international flights. The disparities observed in microbial abundance and diversity further underscore the immense value of state-of-the art molecular assays in augmenting traditional culture-based techniques.},

@article{Ritchie2012,
abstract = {Programmed -1 frameshifting, whereby the reading frame of a ribosome on messenger RNA is shifted in order to generate an alternate gene product, is often triggered by a pseudoknot structure in the mRNA in combination with an upstream slippery sequence. The efficiency of frameshifting varies widely for different sites, but the factors that determine frameshifting efficiency are not yet fully understood. Previous work has suggested that frameshifting efficiency is related to the resistance of the pseudoknot against mechanical unfolding. We tested this hypothesis by studying the mechanical properties of a panel of pseudoknots with frameshifting efficiencies ranging from 2\% to 30\%: four pseudoknots from retroviruses, two from luteoviruses, one from a coronavirus, and a nonframeshifting bacteriophage pseudoknot. Using optical tweezers to apply tension across the RNA, we measured the distribution of forces required to unfold each pseudoknot. We found that neither the average unfolding force, nor the unfolding kinetics, nor the parameters describing the energy landscape for mechanical unfolding of the pseudoknot (energy barrier height and distance to the transition state) could be correlated to frameshifting efficiency. These results indicate that the resistance of pseudoknots to mechanical unfolding is not a primary determinant of frameshifting efficiency. However, increased frameshifting efficiency was correlated with an increased tendency to form alternate, incompletely folded structures, suggesting a more complex picture of the role of the pseudoknot involving the conformational dynamics.},

@article{Wang2008,
abstract = {We established a theoretical framework for studying nonequilibrium networks with two distinct natures essential for characterizing the global probabilistic dynamics: the underlying potential landscape and the corresponding curl flux. We applied the idea to a biochemical oscillation network and found that the underlying potential landscape for the oscillation limit cycle has a distinct closed ring valley (Mexican hat-like) shape when the fluctuations are small. This global landscape structure leads to attractions of the system to the ring valley. On the ring, we found that the nonequilibrium flux is the driving force for oscillations. Therefore, both structured landscape and flux are needed to guarantee a robust oscillating network. The barrier height separating the oscillation ring and other areas derived from the landscape topography is shown to be correlated with the escaping time from the limit cycle attractor and provides a quantitative measure of the robustness for the network. The landscape becomes shallower and the closed ring valley shape structure becomes weaker (lower barrier height) with larger fluctuations. We observe that the period and the amplitude of the oscillations are more dispersed and oscillations become less coherent when the fluctuations increase. We also found that the entropy production of the whole network, characterizing the dissipation costs from the combined effects of both landscapes and fluxes, decreases when the fluctuations decrease. Therefore, less dissipation leads to more robust networks. Our approach is quite general and applicable to other networks, dynamical systems, and biological evolution. It can help in designing robust networks.},

Here we report on the potential metabolic activity of microbes and the state of community DNA in ice derived from Mullins and upper Beacon Valleys. The minimum age of the former is 100 ka, whereas that of the latter is approximately 8 Ma, making it the oldest known ice on Earth. In both samples, radiolabeled substrates were incorporated into macromolecules, and microbes grew in nutrient-enriched meltwaters, but metabolic activity and cell viability were critically compromised with age. Although a 16S rDNA-based community reconstruction suggested relatively low bacterial sequence diversity in both ice samples, metagenomic analyses of community DNA revealed many diverse orthologs to extant metabolic genes. Analyses of five ice samples, spanning the last 8 million years in this region, demonstrated an exponential decline in the average community DNA size with a half-life of approximately 1.1 million years, thereby constraining the geological preservation of microbes in icy environments and the possible exchange of genetic material to the oceans.},

abstract = {New methods are described for finding recurrent three-dimensional (3D) motifs in RNA atomic-resolution structures. Recurrent RNA 3D motifs are sets of RNA nucleotides with similar spatial arrangements. They can be local or composite. Local motifs comprise nucleotides that occur in the same hairpin or internal loop. Composite motifs comprise nucleotides belonging to three or more different RNA strand segments or molecules. We use a base-centered approach to construct efficient, yet exhaustive search procedures using geometric, symbolic, or mixed representations of RNA structure that we implement in a suite of MATLAB programs, "Find RNA 3D" (FR3D). The first modules of FR3D preprocess structure files to classify base-pair and -stacking interactions. Each base is represented geometrically by the position of its glycosidic nitrogen in 3D space and by the rotation matrix that describes its orientation with respect to a common frame. Base-pairing and base-stacking interactions are calculated from the base geometries and are represented symbolically according to the Leontis/Westhof basepairing classification, extended to include base-stacking. These data are stored and used to organize motif searches. For geometric searches, the user supplies the 3D structure of a query motif which FR3D uses to find and score geometrically similar candidate motifs, without regard to the sequential position of their nucleotides in the RNA chain or the identity of their bases. To score and rank candidate motifs, FR3D calculates a geometric discrepancy by rigidly rotating candidates to align optimally with the query motif and then comparing the relative orientations of the corresponding bases in the query and candidate motifs. Given the growing size of the RNA structure database, it is impossible to explicitly compute the discrepancy for all conceivable candidate motifs, even for motifs with less than ten nucleotides. The screening algorithm that we describe finds all candidate motifs whose geometric discrepancy with respect to the query motif falls below a user-specified cutoff discrepancy. This technique can be applied to RMSD searches. Candidate motifs identified geometrically may be further screened symbolically to identify those that contain particular basepair types or base-stacking arrangements or that conform to sequence continuity or nucleotide identity constraints. Purely symbolic searches for motifs containing user-defined sequence, continuity and interaction constraints have also been implemented. We demonstrate that FR3D finds all occurrences, both local and composite and with nucleotide substitutions, of sarcin/ricin and kink-turn motifs in the 23S and 5S ribosomal RNA 3D structures of the H. marismortui 50S ribosomal subunit and assigns the lowest discrepancy scores to bona fide examples of these motifs. The search algorithms have been optimized for speed to allow users to search the non-redundant RNA 3D structure database on a personal computer in a matter of minutes.},

abstract = {Splice site nucleotide substitutions can be analyzed by comparing the individual information contents (Ri, bits) of the normal and variant splice junction sequences [Rogan and Schneider, 1995]. In the present study, we related splicing abnormalities to changes in Ri values of 111 previously reported splice site substitutions in 41 different genes. Mutant donor and acceptor sites have significantly less information than their normal counterparts. With one possible exception, primary mutant sites with <2.4 bits were not spliced. Sites with Ri values > or = 2.4 bits but less than the corresponding natural site usually decreased, but did not abolish splicing. Substitutions that produced small changes in Ri probably do not impair splicing and are often polymorphisms. The Ri values of activated cryptic sites were generally comparable to or greater than those of the corresponding natural splice sites. Information analysis revealed preexisting cryptic splice junctions that are used instead of the mutated natural site. Other cryptic sites were created or strengthened by sequence changes that simultaneously altered the natural site. Comparison between normal and mutant splice site Ri values distinguishes substitutions that impair splicing from those which do not, distinguishes null alleles from those that are partially functional, and detects activated cryptic splice sites.},

Here we describe a new chlorophyte isolated from a low temperature pond, on the Ross Ice Shelf near Bratina Island, Antarctica. Phylogenetic and morphological analyses place this strain in the Chlorella clade, and we have named this new chlorophyte Chlorella BI. Chlorella BI is a psychrophilic species, exhibiting optimum temperature for growth at around 10 degrees C. However, psychrophily in the Antarctic Chlorella was not linked to high levels of membrane-associated poly-unsaturated fatty acids. Unlike the model Antarctic lake alga, Chlamydomonas raudensis UWO241, Chlorella BI has retained the ability for dynamic short term adjustment of light energy distribution between photosystem II (PS II) and photosystem I (PS I). In addition, Chlorella BI can grow under a variety of trophic modes, including heterotrophic growth in the dark. Thus, this newly isolated photopsychrophile has retained a higher versatility in response to environmental change than other well studied cold-adapted chlorophytes.},

abstract = {Environmental surveys indicate that the Archaea are diverse and abundant not only in extreme environments, but also in soil, oceans and freshwater, where they may fulfil a key role in the biogeochemical cycles of the planet. Archaea display unique capacities, such as methanogenesis and survival at temperatures higher than 90 degrees C, that make them crucial for understanding the nature of the biota of early Earth. Molecular, genomics and phylogenetics data strengthen Woese's definition of Archaea as a third domain of life in addition to Bacteria and Eukarya. Phylogenomics analyses of the components of different molecular systems are highlighting a core of mainly vertically inherited genes in Archaea. This allows recovering a globally well-resolved picture of archaeal evolution, as opposed to what is observed for Bacteria and Eukarya. This may be due to the fact that no rapid divergence occurred at the emergence of present-day archaeal lineages. This phylogeny supports a hyperthermophilic and non-methanogenic ancestor to present-day archaeal lineages, and a profound divergence between two major phyla, the Crenarchaeota and the Euryarchaeota, that may not have an equivalent in the other two domains of life. Nanoarchaea may not represent a third and ancestral archaeal phylum, but a fast-evolving euryarchaeal lineage. Methanogenesis seems to have appeared only once and early in the evolution of Euryarchaeota. Filling up this picture of archaeal evolution by adding presently uncultivated species, and placing it back in geological time remain two essential goals for the future.},

abstract = {Microorganisms growing near and above 100 degrees C have recently been discovered near shallow and deep sea hydrothermal vents. Most are obligately dependent upon the reduction of elemental sulfur (S0) to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) for optimal growth, even though S0 reduction readily occurs abiotically at their growth temperatures. The sulfur reductase activity of the anaerobic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus, which grows optimally at 100 degrees C by a metabolism that produces H2S if S0 is present, was found in the cytoplasm. It was purified anaerobically and was shown to be identical to the hydrogenase that had been previously purified from this organism. Both S0 and polysulfide served as substrates for H2S production, and the S0 reduction activity but not the H2-oxidation activity was enhanced by the redox protein rubredoxin. The H2-oxidizing and S0-reduction activities of the enzyme also showed different responses to pH, temperature, and inhibitors. This bifunctional "sulfhydrogenase" enzyme can, therefore, dispose of the excess reductant generated during fermentation using either protons or polysulfides as the electron acceptor. In addition, purified hydrogenases from both hyperthermophilic and mesophilic representatives of the archaeal and bacterial domains were shown to reduce S0 to H2S. It is suggested that the function of some form of ancestral hydrogenase was S0 reduction rather than, or in addition to, the reduction of protons.},

The DNA G+C content of strain 59SA(T) was 38.7 mol\%, the major respiratory quinone was MK-7 and the predominant cellular fatty acids were 20 : 4omega6c and 16 : 0. On the basis of the data from DNA-DNA hybridization, physiological and chemotaxonomic analyses and 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons, strain 59SA(T) represents a novel species of the genus Aureispira, for which the name Aureispira maritima sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 59SA(T) (=IAM 15439(T)=TISTR 1726(T)).},

abstract = {Our knowledge about the microorganisms living in the high Arctic Ocean is still rudimentary compared to other oceans mostly because of logistical challenges imposed by its inhospitable climate and the presence of a multi-year ice cap. We have used 18S rRNA gene libraries to study the diversity of microbial eukaryotes in the upper part of the water column (0-170 m depth), the sea ice (0-1.5 m depth) and the overlying snow from samples collected in the vicinity of the North Pole (N88°35', E015°59) at the very end of the long polar night. We detected very diverse eukaryotes belonging to Alveolata, Fungi, Amoebozoa, Viridiplantae, Metazoa, Rhizaria, Heterokonta, and Telonemia. Different alveolates (dinoflagellates and Marine Alveolate Groups I and II species) were the most abundant and diverse in gene libraries from water and sea ice, representing 80\% of the total number of clones and operational taxonomic units. Only contaminants and/or species from continental ecosystems were detected in snow, suggesting wind- and animal- or human-mediated cosmopolitan dispersal of some taxa. By contrast, sea ice and seawater samples harbored a larger and more similar inter-sample protist diversity as compared with snow. The North Pole was found to harbor distinctive eukaryotic communities along the vertical gradient with an unparalleled diversity of core dinoflagellates, largely dominant in libraries from the water column, as compared to other oceanic locations. In contrast, phototrophic organisms typical of Arctic sea ice and plankton, such as diatoms and prasinophytes, were very rare in our samples. This was most likely due to a decrease of their populations after several months of polar night darkness and to the presence of rich populations of diverse grazers. Whereas strict phototrophs were scarce, we identified a variety of likely mixotrophic taxa, which supports the idea that mixotrophy may be important for the survival of diverse protists through the long polar night.},

Under close-to-physiological conditions, these elements maintain well-ordered characteristic conformations. In unbound subunits, the features creating intersubunit bridges within associated ribosomes lie on the interface surface, and the features that bind factors and substrates reach toward the binding site only when conditions are ripe.},

Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the novel isolate was affiliated to the family 'Flammeovirgaceae' of the phylum Bacteroidetes and that it showed highest sequence similarity (85.5 \%) to Flammeovirga yaeyamensis NBRC 100898(T). The novel isolate could be differentiated phenotypically and physiologically from recognized members of the family 'Flammeovirgaceae'. The G+C content of the DNA was 43.0 mol\%, MK-7 was the major menaquinone and iso-C(15 : 0), C(16 : 1)omega7c and C(16 : 1)omega5c were the major fatty acids. On the basis of this polyphasic evidence, it was concluded that strain Shu-F-UV2-2(T) represents a novel species in a new genus of the family 'Flammeovirgaceae', for which the name Perexilibacter aurantiacus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is Shu-F-UV2-2(T) (=MBIC06993(T)=IAM 15413(T)=KCTC 12867(T)).},

abstract = {Alternative splicing is thought to be regulated by nonspliceosomal RNA binding proteins that modulate the association of core components of the spliceosome with the pre-mRNA. Although the majority of metazoan genes encode pre-mRNAs that are alternatively spliced, remarkably few splicing regulators are currently known. Here, we used RNA interference to examine the role of >70\% of the Drosophila RNA-binding proteins in regulating alternative splicing. We identified 47 proteins as splicing regulators, 26 of which have not previously been implicated in alternative splicing. Many of the regulators we identified are nonspliceosomal RNA-binding proteins. However, our screen unexpectedly revealed that altering the concentration of certain core components of the spliceosome specifically modulates alternative splicing. These results significantly expand the number of known splicing regulators and reveal an extraordinary richness in the mechanisms that regulate alternative splicing.},

abstract = {We report an efficient method for detecting functional RNAs. The approach, which combines comparative sequence analysis and structure prediction, already has yielded excellent results for a small number of aligned sequences and is suitable for large-scale genomic screens. It consists of two basic components: (i) a measure for RNA secondary structure conservation based on computing a consensus secondary structure, and (ii) a measure for thermodynamic stability, which, in the spirit of a z score, is normalized with respect to both sequence length and base composition but can be calculated without sampling from shuffled sequences. Functional RNA secondary structures can be identified in multiple sequence alignments with high sensitivity and high specificity. We demonstrate that this approach is not only much more accurate than previous methods but also significantly faster. The method is implemented in the program rnaz, which can be downloaded from www.tbi.univie.ac.at/\~{}wash/RNAz. We screened all alignments of length n > or = 50 in the Comparative Regulatory Genomics database, which compiles conserved noncoding elements in upstream regions of orthologous genes from human, mouse, rat, Fugu, and zebrafish. We recovered all of the known noncoding RNAs and cis-acting elements with high significance and found compelling evidence for many other conserved RNA secondary structures not described so far to our knowledge.},

abstract = {The nucleoid-associated protein FIS modulates the topology of DNA in a growth-phase dependent manner functioning homeostatically to counteract excessive levels of negative superhelicity. We propose that this is achieved by at least two mechanisms: the physical constraint of low levels of negative superhelicity by FIS binding to DNA and by a reduction in the expression and effectiveness of DNA gyrase. In addition, high levels of expression of the fis gene do themselves require a high negative superhelical density. On DNA substrates containing phased high affinity binding sites, as exemplified by the upstream activating sequence of the tyrT promoter, FIS forms tightly bent DNA structures, or microloops, that are necessary for the optimal expression of the promoter. We suggest that these microloops compensate in part for the FIS-induced lowering of the superhelical density.},

Adults of the smallest flying insects of the parasitic wasp genus Megaphragma (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) have only 339-372 nuclei in the central nervous system, i.e., their ganglia, including the brain, consist almost exclusively of processes of neurons. In contrast, their pupae have ganglia more typical of other insects, with about 7400 nuclei in the central nervous system. During the final phases of pupal development, most neuronal cell bodies lyse. As adults, these insects have many fewer nucleated neurons, a small number of cell bodies in different stages of lysis, and about 7000 anucleate cells. Although most neurons lack nuclei, these insects exhibit many important behaviors, including flight and searching for hosts.},

First, the development of a new online resource called       RNA 3D Hub is described, which is intended to provide a useful       resource for structure modeling and prediction. It houses       non-redundant sets of RNA-containing 3D structures, RNA 3D       motifs extracted from all RNA 3D structures, and the RNA 3D       Motif Atlas, a representative collection of RNA 3D motifs.       Unique and stable ids are assigned to all non-redundant       equivalence classes of structure files, to all motifs, and to       all motif instances. RNA 3D Hub is updated automatically on a       regular schedule and is available at       http://rna.bgsu.edu/rna3dhub.</p> <p>In the second part of the       dissertation, the development of WebFR3D       (http://rna.bgsu.edu/webfr3d), a new webserver for finding and       aligning RNA 3D motifs, is described and its use in a       biologically relevant context is then illustrated using two RNA       3D motifs.

Information about the position or orientation of the binding sites within those fragments is not needed. The method compares the "information content" of a large number of possible binding site alignments to arrive at a matrix representation of the binding site pattern. The specificity of the protein is represented as a matrix, rather than a consensus sequence, allowing patterns that are typical of regulatory protein-binding sites to be identified. The reliability of the method improves as the number of sequences increases, but the time required increases only linearly with the number of sequences. An example, using known cAMP receptor protein-binding sites, illustrates the method.},

abstract = {Structure and dynamics are both critical to RNA's vital functions in biology. Numerous techniques can elucidate the structural dynamics of RNA, but computational approaches based on experimental data arguably hold the promise of providing the most detail. In this Account, we highlight areas wherein molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanical (QM) techniques are applied to RNA, particularly in relation to complementary experimental studies. We have expanded on atomic-resolution crystal structures of RNAs in functionally relevant states by applying explicit solvent MD simulations to explore their dynamics and conformational changes on the submicrosecond time scale. MD relies on simplified atomistic, pairwise additive interaction potentials (force fields). Because of limited sampling, due to the finite accessible simulation time scale and the approximated force field, high-quality starting structures are required. Despite their imperfection, we find that currently available force fields empower MD to provide meaningful and predictive information on RNA dynamics around a crystallographically defined energy minimum. The performance of force fields can be estimated by precise QM calculations on small model systems. Such calculations agree reasonably well with the Cornell et al. AMBER force field, particularly for stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions. A final verification of any force field is accomplished by simulations of complex nucleic acid structures. The performance of the Cornell et al. AMBER force field generally corresponds well with and augments experimental data, but one notable exception could be the capping loops of double-helical stems. In addition, the performance of pairwise additive force fields is obviously unsatisfactory for inclusion of divalent cations, because their interactions lead to major polarization and charge-transfer effects neglected by the force field. Neglect of polarization also limits, albeit to a lesser extent, the description accuracy of other contributions, such as interactions with monovalent ions, conformational flexibility of the anionic sugar-phosphate backbone, hydrogen bonding, and solute polarization by solvent. Still, despite limitations, MD simulations are a valid tool for analyzing the structural dynamics of existing experimental structures. Careful analysis of MD simulations can identify problematic aspects of an experimental RNA structure, unveil structural characteristics masked by experimental constraints, reveal functionally significant stochastic fluctuations, evaluate the structural role of base ionization, and predict structurally and potentially functionally important details of the solvent behavior, including the presence of tightly bound water molecules. Moreover, combining classical MD simulations with QM calculations in hybrid QM/MM approaches helps in the assessment of the plausibility of chemical mechanisms of catalytic RNAs (ribozymes). In contrast, the reliable prediction of structure from sequence information is beyond the applicability of MD tools. The ultimate utility of computational studies in understanding RNA function thus requires that the results are neither blindly accepted nor flatly rejected, but rather considered in the context of all available experimental data, with great care given to assessing limitations through the available starting structures, force field approximations, and sampling limitations. The examples given in this Account showcase how the judicious use of basic MD simulations has already served as a powerful tool to help evaluate the role of structural dynamics in biological function of RNA.},

Two strains (LMG 21857T and LMG 21854) derive from Arctic sea water whereas the other two strains (LMG 21855 and LMG 21858) were isolated from Antarctic sea water. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that these strains belong to the gamma-subclass of the Proteobacteria and are related to the genus Glaciecola, with 98.0-99.7 \% sequence similarity to Glaciecola mesophila and 94.2-95.3 \% sequence similarity to Glaciecola punicea, their nearest phylogenetic neighbours. Two strains (LMG 21855 and LMG 21858) were identified as G. mesophila, whereas DNA-DNA hybridization results and differences in phenotypic characteristics showed that the other two strains (LMG 21857T and LMG 21854) constitute a novel species within the genus Glaciecola, with a DNA G + C content of 44.0 mol\%. The isolates are Gram-negative, chemoheterotrophic, motile, rod-shaped cells that are psychrotolerant and moderately halophilic. Buds can be produced on mother cells and on prosthecae. Branch formation of prosthecae occurs. Whole-cell fatty acid profiles of the isolates are very similar and include C(16 : 0) and C(16 : 1)omega7c as the major fatty acid components. On the basis of genotypic and phenotypic properties, a novel species of the genus Glaciecola is described, for which the name Glaciecola polaris sp. nov. is proposed, with isolate LMG 21857T (= CIP 108324T = ARK 150T) as the type strain. An emended description of the genus Glaciecola is presented.},

Recent advances in the area of self-replication have led to improved efficiency of autocatalysis, both by increasing the fraction of product molecules that can participate in further rounds of replication, and by improving the efficiency of the catalysts themselves.

abstract = {Translocation is one of the key events in translation, requiring large-scale conformational changes in the ribosome, movements of two transfer RNAs (tRNAs) across a distance of more than 20Å, and the coupled movement of the messenger RNA (mRNA) by one codon, completing one cycle of peptide-chain elongation. Translocation is catalyzed by elongation factor G (EF-G in bacteria), which hydrolyzes GTP in the process. However, how the conformational rearrangements of the ribosome actually drive the movements of the tRNAs and how EF-G GTP hydrolysis plays a role in this process are still unclear. Fluorescence methods, both single-molecule and bulk, have provided a dynamic view of translocation, allowing us to follow the different conformational changes of the ribosome in real-time. The application of electron microscopy has revealed new conformational intermediates during translocation and important structural rearrangements in the ribosome that drive tRNA movement, while computational approaches have added quantitative views of the translational pathway. These recent advances shed light on the process of translocation, providing insight on how to resolve the different descriptions of translocation in the current literature.},

In addition, although past structures of the 50S subunit have found no ordered proteins at the PTC, biochemical evidence suggests that specific proteins are capable of interacting with the 3' ends of tRNA ligands. Here we present structures, at 3.6-A and 3.5-A resolution respectively, of the 70S ribosome in complex with A- and P-site tRNAs that mimic pre- and post-peptidyl-transfer states. These structures demonstrate that the PTC is very similar between the 50S subunit and the intact ribosome.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Hamiltonian Path Problem asks whether there is a route in a directed graph from a beginning node to an ending node, visiting each node exactly once. The Hamiltonian Path Problem is NP complete, achieving surprising computational complexity with modest increases in size. This challenge has inspired researchers to broaden the definition of a computer. DNA computers have been developed that solve NP complete problems. Bacterial computers can be programmed by constructing genetic circuits to execute an algorithm that is responsive to the environment and whose result can be observed. Each bacterium can examine a solution to a mathematical problem and billions of them can explore billions of possible solutions. Bacterial computers can be automated, made responsive to selection, and reproduce themselves so that more processing capacity is applied to problems over time. RESULTS: We programmed bacteria with a genetic circuit that enables them to evaluate all possible paths in a directed graph in order to find a Hamiltonian path. We encoded a three node directed graph as DNA segments that were autonomously shuffled randomly inside bacteria by a Hin/hixC recombination system we previously adapted from Salmonella typhimurium for use in Escherichia coli. We represented nodes in the graph as linked halves of two different genes encoding red or green fluorescent proteins. Bacterial populations displayed phenotypes that reflected random ordering of edges in the graph. Individual bacterial clones that found a Hamiltonian path reported their success by fluorescing both red and green, resulting in yellow colonies. We used DNA sequencing to verify that the yellow phenotype resulted from genotypes that represented Hamiltonian path solutions, demonstrating that our bacterial computer functioned as expected. CONCLUSION: We successfully designed, constructed, and tested a bacterial computer capable of finding a Hamiltonian path in a three node directed graph. This proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates that bacterial computing is a new way to address NP-complete problems using the inherent advantages of genetic systems. The results of our experiments also validate synthetic biology as a valuable approach to biological engineering. We designed and constructed basic parts, devices, and systems using synthetic biology principles of standardization and abstraction.},

abstract = {Seven strains of aerobic, endospore-forming bacteria were found in soil taken from an active fumarole on Lucifer Hill, Candlemas Island, South Sandwich archipelago, Antarctica, and four strains were from soil of an inactive fumarole at the foot of the hill. Amplified rDNA restriction analysis, 16S rDNA sequence comparisons, SDS-PAGE and routine phenotypic tests support the proposal of two novel species of Paenibacillus, Paenibacillus cineris sp. nov. and Paenibacillus cookii sp. nov., the type strains of which are LMG 18439T (=CIP 108109T) and LMG 18419T (=CIP 108110T), respectively. A further strain, isolated from a gelatin-production process, showed more than 99\% 16S rDNA sequence similarity to the proposed P. cookii type strain and, although the gelatin isolate was atypical when compared with the fumarole isolates by repeated element primed-PCR, SDS-PAGE and phenotypic analyses, it was shown by DNA-DNA reassociation studies to belong to the same species. Strains of P. cookii produce spreading growth with motile microcolonies. Both species produce swollen sporangia that are typical for the genus, they both show 97.6\% 16S rDNA sequence similarity to Paenibacillus azoreducens, they have 51.5-51.6 mol\% G+C in their DNA and their major fatty acid is anteiso-C(15 : 0); however, fatty acids C(16 : 0) and anteiso-C(17 : 0) represent, respectively, 18 and 10 \% of the total in P. cineris, but 11 and 20\% in P. cookii.},

abstract = {The standard approach for single-sequence RNA secondary structure prediction uses a nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model with several thousand experimentally determined energy parameters. An attractive alternative is to use statistical approaches with parameters estimated from growing databases of structural RNAs. Good results have been reported for discriminative statistical methods using complex nearest-neighbor models, including CONTRAfold, Simfold, and ContextFold. Little work has been reported on generative probabilistic models (stochastic context-free grammars [SCFGs]) of comparable complexity, although probabilistic models are generally easier to train and to use. To explore a range of probabilistic models of increasing complexity, and to directly compare probabilistic, thermodynamic, and discriminative approaches, we created TORNADO, a computational tool that can parse a wide spectrum of RNA grammar architectures (including the standard nearest-neighbor model and more) using a generalized super-grammar that can be parameterized with probabilities, energies, or arbitrary scores. By using TORNADO, we find that probabilistic nearest-neighbor models perform comparably to (but not significantly better than) discriminative methods. We find that complex statistical models are prone to overfitting RNA structure and that evaluations should use structurally nonhomologous training and test data sets. Overfitting has affected at least one published method (ContextFold). The most important barrier to improving statistical approaches for RNA secondary structure prediction is the lack of diversity of well-curated single-sequence RNA secondary structures in current RNA databases.},

abstract = {The concept that one bacterial species can interfere with the ability of another to colonize and infect the host has at its foundation the prerequisite that bacteria must attach to biological surfaces to cause infection. Although this is an over-simplification of pathogenesis, it has led to studies aimed at creating vaccines that block adhesion events. Arguably, the use of commensal bacteria (also referred to as "normal flora", "indigenous" or "autochthonous" microorganisms) to inhibit pathogens has even greater potential than vaccine use, because these bacteria are natural competitors of pathogens and their action does not require host immune stimulation. Exogenous application of commensal organisms (probiotics) has been shown to reduce the risk of infections in the gut, urogenital tract and wound sites. To manipulate and optimize these effects, further studies are required to understand cell signaling amongst commensals and pathogens within biofilms adherent to host tissues. The potential for new therapeutic regimens using probiotics is significant and worthy of further study.},

abstract = {RNA is now known to possess various structural, regulatory and enzymatic functions for survival of cellular organisms. Functional RNA structures are generally created by three-dimensional organization of small structural motifs, formed by base pairing between self-complementary sequences from different parts of the RNA chain. In addition to the canonical Watson-Crick or wobble base pairs, several non-canonical base pairs are found to crucial to the structural organization of RNA molecules. They appear within different structural motifs and are found to stabilize the molecule through long-range intra-molecular interactions between basic structural motifs like double helices and loops. These base pairs also impart functional variation to the minor groove of A-form RNA helices, thus forming anchoring site for metabolites and ligands. Non-canonical base pairs are formed by edge-to-edge hydrogen bonding interactions between the bases. A large number of theoretical studies have been done to detect and analyze these non-canonical base pairs within crystal or NMR derived structures of different functional RNA. Theoretical studies of these isolated base pairs using ab initio quantum chemical methods as well as molecular dynamics simulations of larger fragments have also established that many of these non-canonical base pairs to be as stable as the canonical Watson-Crick base pairs. This review focuses on the various structural aspects of non-canonical base pairs in the organization of RNA molecules and the possible applications of these base pairs in predicting RNA structures with more accuracy.},

@book{Stoltzfus2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scientists rarely reuse expert knowledge of phylogeny, in spite of years of effort to assemble a great "Tree of Life" (ToL). A notable exception involves the use of Phylomatic, which provides tools to generate custom phylogenies from a large, pre-computed, expert phylogeny of plant taxa. This suggests great potential for a more generalized system that, starting with a query consisting of a list of any known species, would rectify non-standard names, identify expert phylogenies containing the implicated taxa, prune away unneeded parts, and supply branch lengths and annotations, resulting in a custom phylogeny suited to the user's needs. Such a system could become a sustainable community resource if implemented as a distributed system of loosely coupled parts that interact through clearly defined interfaces. RESULTS: With the aim of building such a "phylotastic" system, the NESCent Hackathons, Interoperability, Phylogenies (HIP) working group recruited 2 dozen scientist-programmers to a weeklong programming hackathon in June 2012. During the hackathon (and a three-month follow-up period), 5 teams produced designs, implementations, documentation, presentations, and tests including: (1) a generalized scheme for integrating components; (2) proof-of-concept pruners and controllers; (3) a meta-API for taxonomic name resolution services; (4) a system for storing, finding, and retrieving phylogenies using semantic web technologies for data exchange, storage, and querying; (5) an innovative new service, DateLife.org, which synthesizes pre-computed, time-calibrated phylogenies to assign ages to nodes; and (6) demonstration projects. These outcomes are accessible via a public code repository (GitHub.com), a website (www.phylotastic.org), and a server image. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 9 person-months of effort (centered on a software development hackathon) resulted in the design and implementation of proof-of-concept software for 4 core phylotastic components, 3 controllers, and 3 end-user demonstration tools. While these products have substantial limitations, they suggest considerable potential for a distributed system that makes phylogenetic knowledge readily accessible in computable form. Widespread use of phylotastic systems will create an electronic marketplace for sharing phylogenetic knowledge that will spur innovation in other areas of the ToL enterprise, such as annotation of sources and methods and third-party methods of quality assessment.},

abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis form communities (called biofilms) on inserted medical devices, leading to infections that affect many millions of patients worldwide and cause substantial morbidity and mortality. As biofilms are resistant to antibiotics, device removal is often required to resolve the infection. Thus, there is a need for new therapeutic strategies and molecular data that might assist their development. Surface proteins S. aureus surface protein G (SasG) and accumulation-associated protein (S. epidermidis) promote biofilm formation through their "B" regions. B regions contain tandemly arrayed G5 domains interspersed with approximately 50 residue sequences (herein called E) and have been proposed to mediate intercellular accumulation through Zn(2+)-mediated homodimerization. Although E regions are predicted to be unstructured, SasG and accumulation-associated protein form extended fibrils on the bacterial surface. Here we report structures of E-G5 and G5-E-G5 from SasG and biophysical characteristics of single and multidomain fragments. E sequences fold cooperatively and form interlocking interfaces with G5 domains in a head-to-tail fashion, resulting in a contiguous, elongated, monomeric structure. E and G5 domains lack a compact hydrophobic core, and yet G5 domain and multidomain constructs have thermodynamic stabilities only slightly lower than globular proteins of similar size. Zn(2+) does not cause SasG domains to form dimers. The work reveals a paradigm for formation of fibrils on the 100-nm scale and suggests that biofilm accumulation occurs through a mechanism distinct from the "zinc zipper." Finally, formation of two domains by each repeat (as in SasG) might reduce misfolding in proteins when the tandem arrangement of highly similar sequences is advantageous.},

There are examples of rRNA modification involvement in the gene expression regulation in the cell. There is a need for large data set analysis in the search for potential functional partners for rRNA modification. In this study, we extracted phylogenetic profile, genome neighbourhood, co-expression and phenotype profile and co-purification data regarding Escherichia coli rRNA modification enzymes from public databases. Results were visualized as graphs using Cytoscape and analysed. Majority linked genes/proteins belong to translation apparatus. Among co-purification partners of rRNA modification enzymes are several candidates for experimental validation. Phylogenetic profiling revealed links of pseudouridine synthetases with RF2, RsmH with translation factors IF2, RF1 and LepA and RlmM with RdgC. Genome neighbourhood connections revealed several putative functionally linked genes, e.g. rlmH with genes coding for cell wall biosynthetic proteins and others. Comparative analysis of expression profiles (Gene Expression Omnibus) revealed two main associations, a group of genes expressed during fast growth and association of rrmJ with heat shock genes. This study might be used as a roadmap for further experimental verification of predicted functional interactions.},

New high-resolution crystal structures of functional ribosome complexes and cryo-EM structures of translating ribosomes are presented, while partial reactions of translation are examined in structural and mechanistic detail, featuring translocation as a most dynamic process. Mechanisms of initiation, both in bacterial and eukaryotic systems, translation termination, and novel details of the functions of the respective factors are described. Structure and interactions of the nascent peptide within, and emerging from, the ribosomal peptide exit tunnel are addressed in several articles. Structural and single-molecule studies reveal a picture of the ribosome exhibiting the energy landscape of a processive Brownian machine.

abstract = {Halophiles are found in all three domains of life. Within the Bacteria we know halophiles within the phyla Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Bacteroidetes. Within the Archaea the most salt-requiring microorganisms are found in the class Halobacteria. Halobacterium and most of its relatives require over 100-150 g/l salt for growth and structural stability. Also within the order Methanococci we encounter halophilic species. Halophiles and non-halophilic relatives are often found together in the phylogenetic tree, and many genera, families and orders have representatives with greatly different salt requirement and tolerance. A few phylogenetically coherent groups consist of halophiles only: the order Halobacteriales, family Halobacteriaceae (Euryarchaeota) and the anaerobic fermentative bacteria of the order Halanaerobiales (Firmicutes). The family Halomonadaceae (Gammaproteobacteria) almost exclusively contains halophiles. Halophilic microorganisms use two strategies to balance their cytoplasm osmotically with their medium. The first involves accumulation of molar concentrations of KCl. This strategy requires adaptation of the intracellular enzymatic machinery, as proteins should maintain their proper conformation and activity at near-saturating salt concentrations. The proteome of such organisms is highly acidic, and most proteins denature when suspended in low salt. Such microorganisms generally cannot survive in low salt media. The second strategy is to exclude salt from the cytoplasm and to synthesize and/or accumulate organic 'compatible' solutes that do not interfere with enzymatic activity. Few adaptations of the cells' proteome are needed, and organisms using the 'organic-solutes-in strategy' often adapt to a surprisingly broad salt concentration range. Most halophilic Bacteria, but also the halophilic methanogenic Archaea use such organic solutes. A variety of such solutes are known, including glycine betaine, ectoine and other amino acid derivatives, sugars and sugar alcohols. The 'high-salt-in strategy' is not limited to the Halobacteriaceae. The Halanaerobiales (Firmicutes) also accumulate salt rather than organic solutes. A third, phylogenetically unrelated organism accumulates KCl: the red extremely halophilic Salinibacter (Bacteroidetes), recently isolated from saltern crystallizer brines. Analysis of its genome showed many points of resemblance with the Halobacteriaceae, probably resulting from extensive horizontal gene transfer. The case of Salinibacter shows that more unusual types of halophiles may be waiting to be discovered.},

The structures further show that interactions between $\sigma$ and template-strand ssDNA preorganize template-strand ssDNA to engage the RNAP active center.},

abstract = {The adhesive strategy of the gecko relies on foot pads composed of specialized keratinous foot-hairs called setae, which are subdivided into terminal spatulae of approximately 200 nm (ref. 1). Contact between the gecko foot and an opposing surface generates adhesive forces that are sufficient to allow the gecko to cling onto vertical and even inverted surfaces. Although strong, the adhesion is temporary, permitting rapid detachment and reattachment of the gecko foot during locomotion. Researchers have attempted to capture these properties of gecko adhesive in synthetic mimics with nanoscale surface features reminiscent of setae; however, maintenance of adhesive performance over many cycles has been elusive, and gecko adhesion is greatly diminished upon full immersion in water. Here we report a hybrid biologically inspired adhesive consisting of an array of nanofabricated polymer pillars coated with a thin layer of a synthetic polymer that mimics the wet adhesive proteins found in mussel holdfasts. Wet adhesion of the nanostructured polymer pillar arrays increased nearly 15-fold when coated with mussel-mimetic polymer. The system maintains its adhesive performance for over a thousand contact cycles in both dry and wet environments. This hybrid adhesive, which combines the salient design elements of both gecko and mussel adhesives, should be useful for reversible attachment to a variety of surfaces in any environment.},

Phylogenetic studies have revealed that a large proportion of the barophilic bacteria currently in culture collections belong to a distinct subgroup of the genus Shewanella, referred to as the "barophile branch." Many of the basic properties of barophiles that enable their survival at extremes of pressure remain to be elucidated. However, several genes whose expression is regulated by pressure, or which appear to be critical to baroadaptation, have been uncovered. One such operon, whose presence appears to be restricted to the "barophile branch," has been identified in DNA samples obtained from sediments recovered in the deepest ocean trench. In the case of another set of pressure-regulated genes, regulatory elements required for pressure signaling have been uncovered. The nature and regulation of these genes is discussed.},

abstract = {In the early 1950's, 'host-controlled variation in bacterial viruses' was reported as a non-hereditary phenomenon: one cycle of viral growth on certain bacterial hosts affected the ability of progeny virus to grow on other hosts by either restricting or enlarging their host range. Unlike mutation, this change was reversible, and one cycle of growth in the previous host returned the virus to its original form. These simple observations heralded the discovery of the endonuclease and methyltransferase activities of what are now termed Type I, II, III and IV DNA restriction-modification systems. The Type II restriction enzymes (e.g. EcoRI) gave rise to recombinant DNA technology that has transformed molecular biology and medicine. This review traces the discovery of restriction enzymes and their continuing impact on molecular biology and medicine.},

abstract = {A system for studying Z-DNA formation in the Escherichia coli chromosome was developed. Prior investigations in recombinant plasmids showed that alternating (Pur-Pyr) sequences can adopt a left-handed Z-DNA conformation both in vitro and in vivo. We constructed mobile, transposon-based cassettes carrying cloned (Pur-Pyr) sequences containing an EcoRI site in the center. These cassettes were subsequently inserted into different locations in the E. coli chromosome in a random fashion. A number of stable insertions were characterized by Southern analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis mapping. A cloned temperature-sensitive MEcoRI methylase was expressed in trans as the probe to study Z-DNA formation in vivo. In this system, the control EcoRI sites were quickly methylated when cells were placed at the permissive temperature. Strong inhibition of the methylation was observed, however, only for the EcoRI sites embedded in a 56-bp run of (C-G). In contrast, the shorter sequence of 32 bp did not show this behavior. Prior in vitro determinations revealed that the longer tract required less energy to stabilize the Z-helix than the shorter block. We conclude that the observed inhibition of methylation is due to Z-DNA formation in the E. coli chromosome. In vitro, these sequences undergo the B- to Z-DNA transition at a supercoil density of -0.026 for the 56-bp insert and -0.032 for the 32-bp block. Since only the longer (C-G) tract but not the shorter run adopted the left-handed conformation in the chromosome, we propose that these densities establish the boundaries in the different chromosomal loci investigated; these boundaries are in good agreement with the extremes found in plasmids.},

We collected the optimal growth temperatures (Topt) and the G+C contents of genomic DNA; 23S, 16S, and 5S ribosomal RNAs; and transfer RNAs for 764 prokaryotic species. No correlation was found between genomic G+C content and Topt, but there were striking correlations between the G+C content of ribosomal and transfer RNA stems and Topt. Two explanations have been proposed-neutral evolution and selection pressure-for the approximate equalities of G and C (respectively, A and T) contents within each strand of DNA molecules. Our results do not support the notion that selection pressure induces complementary oligonucleotides in close proximity and therefore numerous secondary structures in prokaryotic DNA, as the genomic G+C content does not behave in the same way as that of folded RNA with respect to optimal growth temperature.},

However, the molecular basis for how the two ribosomal subunits rearrange contacts with each other during ratcheting while remaining stably associated is not known. Here, we describe x-ray crystal structures of the intact Escherichia coli ribosome, either in the apo-form (3.5 angstrom resolution) or with one (4.0 angstrom resolution) or two (4.0 angstrom resolution) anticodon stem-loop tRNA mimics bound, that reveal intermediate states of intersubunit rotation. In the structures, the interface between the small and large ribosomal subunits rearranges in discrete steps along the ratcheting pathway. Positioning of the head domain of the small subunit is controlled by interactions with the large subunit and with the tRNA bound in the peptidyl-tRNA site. The intermediates observed here provide insight into how tRNAs move into the hybrid state of binding that precedes the final steps of mRNA and tRNA translocation.},

abstract = {Summary: With the increasing amount of newly discovered non-coding RNAs, the interactions between RNA molecules become an increasingly important aspect for characterizing their functionality. Many computational tools have been developed to predict the formation of duplexes between two RNAs, either based on single sequences or alignments of homologous sequences. Here, we present RILogo, a program to visualize inter- and intramolecular base pairing between two RNA molecules. The input for RILogo is a pair of structure-annotated sequences or alignments. In the latter case, RILogo displays the alignments in the form of sequence logos, including the mutual information of base paired columns. We also introduce two novel mutual information based measures that weigh the covariance information by the evolutionary distances of the aligned sequences. We show that the new measures have an increased accuracy compared with previous mutual information measures. Availability and implementation: RILogo is freely available as a stand-alone program and is accessible via a web server at http://rth.dk/resources/rilogo.

abstract = {Entry inhibitors represent a new generation of antivirals for the treatment of HIV infection. Several compounds which block the attachment of HIV gp120 to either the CD4 T cell receptor or the CCR5/CXCR4 co-receptors are currently in clinical development. Most of these compounds have different molecular structures and specific mechanisms of action. These agents are eagerly awaited by a growing number of patients carrying viruses resistant viruses to many of the current available reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. For enfuvirtide, the first and, so far, only entry inhibitor approved for clinical use, the main mechanism of resistance is the selection of changes within a 10 amino acid segment encompassing residues 36-45 within the HR1 region of gp41. For other entry inhibitors, multiple changes in different gp120 domains (V1, V2, V3, C2 and C4) have been associated with loss of susceptibility to these agents, although in most cases with limited cross-resistance.},

abstract = {A novel, obligately anaerobic, fermentative bacterium, strain FCF9, was isolated from a 9-m water sample from permanently ice-covered, meromictic Lake Fryxell, Antarctica. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence identity clustered the Antarctic isolate within the Sporomusa-Pectinatus-Selenomonas phyletic group, where it was most closely related to Pelosinus fermentans (95.5\% sequence identity). However, unlike species of Pelosinus, strain FCF9 was psychrophilic, with growth occurring optimally near 15 degrees C, and endospores were not produced. The metabolism of the new organism was strictly fermentative. The substrates fermented by strain FCF9 included only lactate and a few related organic acids. The major products from lactate fermentation were acetate and propionate. On the basis of phylogenetic, morphological, and physiological criteria, strain FCF9(T) is proposed as the type strain of a novel genus and species of psychrophilic-fermenting bacteria, Psychrosinus fermentans gen. nov., sp. nov.},

Although different human tumor viruses express different viral oncogenes and induce different tumors, their oncoproteins often target similar sets of cellular tumor suppressors or signal pathways to immortalize and/or transform infected cells. Expression of the viral E6 and E7 oncogenes in papillomavirus, E1A and E1B oncogenes in adenovirus, large T and small t antigen in polyomavirus, and Tax oncogene in HTLV-1 are regulated by alternative RNA splicing. However, this regulation is only partially understood. DNA tumor viruses also encode noncoding RNAs, including viral microRNAs, that disturb normal cell functions. Among the determined viral microRNA precursors, EBV encodes 25 from two major clusters (BART and BHRF1), KSHV encodes 12 from a latent region, human polyomavirus MCV produce only one microRNA from the late region antisense to early transcripts, but HPVs appears to produce no viral microRNAs.},

abstract = {We use discrete event stochastic simulations to characterize the parameter space of a model of icosahedral viral capsid assembly as functions of monomer-monomer binding rates. The simulations reveal a parameter space characterized by three major assembly mechanisms, a standard nucleation-limited monomer-accretion pathway and two distinct hierarchical assembly pathways, as well as unproductive regions characterized by kinetically trapped species. Much of the productive parameter space also consists of border regions between these domains where hybrid pathways are likely to operate. A simpler octamer system studied for comparison reveals three analogous pathways, but is characterized by much lesser sensitivity to parameter variations in contrast to the sharp changes visible in the icosahedral model. The model suggests that modest changes in assembly conditions, consistent with expected differences between in vitro and in vivo assembly environments, could produce substantial shifts in assembly pathways. These results suggest that we must be cautious in drawing conclusions about in vivo capsid self-assembly dynamics from theoretical or in vitro models, as the nature of the basic assembly mechanisms accessible to a system can substantially differ between simple and complex model systems, between theoretical models and simulation results, and between in vitro and in vivo assembly conditions.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli encodes two rel loci, both of which contribute to the control of synthesis of macromolecules during amino acid starvation. The product of relA (ppGpp synthetase I) is responsible for the synthesis of guanosine tetraphosphate, ppGpp, the signal molecule that exerts stringent control of stable RNA synthesis. The second rel locus, relBE, was identified by mutations in relB that confer a so-called 'delayed-relaxed response' characterized by continued RNA synthesis after a lag period of approximately 10 min after the onset of amino acid starvation. We show here that the delayed-relaxed response is a consequence of hyperactivation of RelE. As in wild-type cells, [ppGpp] increased sharply in relB101 relE cells after the onset of starvation, but returned rapidly to the prestarvation level. RelE is a global inhibitor of translation that is neutralized by RelB by direct protein-protein interaction. Lon protease activates RelE during amino acid starvation by degradation of RelB. We found that mutations in relB that conferred the delayed-relaxed phenotype destabilized RelB. Such mutations confer severe RelE-dependent inhibition of translation during amino acid starvation, indicating hyperactivation of RelE. Hyperactivation of RelE during amino acid starvation was shown directly by measurement of RelE-mediated cleavage of tmRNA. The RelE-mediated shutdown of translation terminated amino acid consumption and explains the rapid restoration of the ppGpp level observed in relB mutant cells. Restoration of the prestarvation level of ppGpp, in turn, allows for the resumption of stable RNA synthesis seen during the delayed-relaxed response.},

abstract = {The availability of high-throughput parallel methods for sequencing microbial communities is increasing our knowledge of the microbial world at an unprecedented rate. Though most attention has focused on determining lower-bounds on the $\alpha$-diversity i.e. the total number of different species present in the environment, tight bounds on this quantity may be highly uncertain because a small fraction of the environment could be composed of a vast number of different species. To better assess what remains unknown, we propose instead to predict the fraction of the environment that belongs to unsampled classes. Modeling samples as draws with replacement of colored balls from an urn with an unknown composition, and under the sole assumption that there are still undiscovered species, we show that conditionally unbiased predictors and exact prediction intervals (of constant length in logarithmic scale) are possible for the fraction of the environment that belongs to unsampled classes. Our predictions are based on a poissonization argument, which we have implemented in what we call the Embedding algorithm. In fixed i.e. non-randomized sample sizes, the algorithm leads to very accurate predictions on a sub-sample of the original sample. We quantify the effect of fixed sample sizes on our prediction intervals and test our methods and others found in the literature against simulated environments, which we devise taking into account datasets from a human-gut and -hand microbiota. Our methodology applies to any dataset that can be conceptualized as a sample with replacement from an urn. In particular, it could be applied, for example, to quantify the proportion of all the unseen solutions to a binding site problem in a random RNA pool, or to reassess the surveillance of a certain terrorist group, predicting the conditional probability that it deploys a new tactic in a next attack.},

abstract = {Individual protein binding sites on DNA can be measured in bits of information. This information is related to the free energy of binding by the second law of thermodynamics, but binding kinetics appear to be inaccessible from sequence information since the relative contributions of the on- and off-rates to the binding constant, and hence the free energy, are unknown. However, the on-rate could be independent of the sequence since a protein is likely to bind once it is near a site. To test this, we used surface plasmon resonance and electromobility shift assays to determine the kinetics for binding of the Fis protein to a range of naturally occurring binding sites. We observed that the logarithm of the off-rate is indeed proportional to the individual information of the binding sites, as predicted. However, the on-rate is also related to the information, but to a lesser degree. We suggest that the on-rate is mostly determined by DNA bending, which in turn is determined by the sequence information. Finally, we observed a break in the binding curve around zero bits of information. The break is expected from information theory because it represents the coding demarcation between specific and nonspecific binding.},

abstract = {Exonic splicing silencers (ESSs) are cis-regulatory elements that inhibit the use of adjacent splice sites, often contributing to alternative splicing (AS). To systematically identify ESSs, an in vivo splicing reporter system was developed to screen a library of random decanucleotides. The screen yielded 141 ESS decamers, 133 of which were unique. The silencer activity of over a dozen of these sequences was also confirmed in a heterologous exon/intron context and in a second cell type. Of the unique ESS decamers, most could be clustered into groups to yield seven putative ESS motifs, some resembling known motifs bound by hnRNPs H and A1. Potential roles of ESSs in constitutive splicing were explored using an algorithm, ExonScan, which simulates splicing based on known or putative splicing-related motifs. ExonScan and related bioinformatic analyses suggest that these ESS motifs play important roles in suppression of pseudoexons, in splice site definition, and in AS.},

abstract = {Covariation analysis is used to identify those positions with similar patterns of sequence variation in an alignment of RNA sequences. These constraints on the evolution of two positions are usually associated with a base pair in a helix. While mutual information (MI) has been used to accurately predict an RNA secondary structure and a few of its tertiary interactions, early studies revealed that phylogenetic event counting methods are more sensitive and provide extra confidence in the prediction of base pairs. We developed a novel and powerful phylogenetic events counting method (PEC) for quantifying positional covariation with the Gutell lab's new RNA Comparative Analysis Database (rCAD). The PEC and MI-based methods each identify unique base pairs, and jointly identify many other base pairs. In total, both methods in combination with an N-best and helix-extension strategy identify the maximal number of base pairs. While covariation methods have effectively and accurately predicted RNAs secondary structure, only a few tertiary structure base pairs have been identified. Analysis presented herein and at the Gutell lab's Comparative RNA Web (CRW) Site reveal that the majority of these latter base pairs do not covary with one another. However, covariation analysis does reveal a weaker although significant covariation between sets of nucleotides that are in proximity in the three-dimensional RNA structure. This reveals that covariation analysis identifies other types of structural constraints beyond the two nucleotides that form a base pair.},

abstract = {In this paper we utilize hidden Markov models (HMMs) and information theory to analyze prokaryotic and eukaryotic promoters. We perform this analysis with special emphasis on the fact that promoters are divided into a number of different classes, depending on which polymerase-associated factors that bind to them. We find that HMMs trained on such subclasses of Escherichia coli promoters (specifically, the so-called sigma 70 and sigma 54 classes) give an excellent classification of unknown promoters with respect to sigma-class. HMMs trained on eukaryotic sequences from human genes also model nicely all the essential well known signals, in addition to a potentially new signal upstream of the TATA-box. We furthermore employ a novel technique for automatically discovering different classes in the input data (the promoters) using a system of self-organizing parallel HMMs. These self-organizing HMMs have at the same time the ability to find clusters and the ability to model the sequential structure in the input data. This is highly relevant in situations where the variance in the data is high, as is the case for the subclass structure in for example promoter sequences.},

This designed small ligand is membrane-permeant and nonfluorescent until it binds with high affinity and specificity to the tetracysteine domain. Such in situ labeling adds much less mass than does green fluorescent protein and offers greater versatility in attachment sites as well as potential spectroscopic and chemical properties.

@article{Arumugam2010,
abstract = {Meiotic cell-cycle progression in progesterone-stimulated Xenopus oocytes requires that the translation of pre-existing maternal mRNAs occur in a strict temporal order. Timing of translation is regulated through elements within the mRNA 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), which respond to cell cycle-dependant signalling. One element that has been previously implicated in the temporal control of mRNA translation is the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE). In this study, we show that the CPE does not direct early mRNA translation. Rather, early translation is directed through specific early factors, including the Musashi-binding element (MBE) and the MBE-binding protein, Musashi. Our findings indicate that although the cyclin B5 3' UTR contains both CPEs and an MBE, the MBE is the critical regulator of early translation. The cyclin B2 3' UTR contains CPEs, but lacks an MBE and is translationally activated late in maturation. Finally, utilizing antisense oligonucleotides to attenuate endogenous Musashi synthesis, we show that Musashi is critical for the initiation of early class mRNA translation and for the subsequent activation of CPE-dependant mRNA translation.},

abstract = {Change of DNA sequence that fuels evolution is, to a certain extent, a deterministic process because mutagenesis does not occur in an absolutely random manner. So far, it has not been possible to decipher the rules that govern DNA sequence evolution due to the extreme complexity of the entire process. In our attempt to approach this issue we focus solely on the mechanisms of mutagenesis and deliberately disregard the role of natural selection. Hence, in this analysis, evolution refers to the accumulation of genetic alterations that originate from mutations and are transmitted through generations without being subjected to natural selection. We have developed a software tool that allows modelling of a DNA sequence as a one-dimensional cellular automaton (CA) with four states per cell which correspond to the four DNA bases, i.e. A, C, T and G. The four states are represented by numbers of the quaternary number system. Moreover, we have developed genetic algorithms (GAs) in order to determine the rules of CA evolution that simulate the DNA evolution process. Linear evolution rules were considered and square matrices were used to represent them. If DNA sequences of different evolution steps are available, our approach allows the determination of the underlying evolution rule(s). Conversely, once the evolution rules are deciphered, our tool may reconstruct the DNA sequence in any previous evolution step for which the exact sequence information was unknown. The developed tool may be used to test various parameters that could influence evolution. We describe a paradigm relying on the assumption that mutagenesis is governed by a near-neighbour-dependent mechanism. Based on the satisfactory performance of our system in the deliberately simplified example, we propose that our approach could offer a starting point for future attempts to understand the mechanisms that govern evolution. The developed software is open-source and has a user-friendly graphical input interface.},

These emerging drugs, which include therapeutic ribozymes, aptamers, and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), demonstrate the unprecedented versatility of RNA. However, RNA is inherently unstable, potentially immunogenic, and typically requires a delivery vehicle for efficient transport to the targeted cells. These issues have hindered the clinical progress of some RNA-based drugs and have contributed to mixed results in clinical testing. Nevertheless, promising results from recent clinical trials suggest that these barriers may be overcome with improved synthetic delivery carriers and chemical modifications of the RNA therapeutics.

abstract = {Translocation of tRNA and mRNA through the ribosome is one of the most dynamic events during protein synthesis. In the cell, translocation is catalysed by EF-G (elongation factor G) and driven by GTP hydrolysis. Major unresolved questions are: how the movement is induced and what the moving parts of the ribosome are. Recent progress in time-resolved cryoelectron microscopy revealed trajectories of tRNA movement through the ribosome. Driven by thermal fluctuations, the ribosome spontaneously samples a large number of conformational states. The spontaneous movement of tRNAs through the ribosome is loosely coupled to the motions within the ribosome. EF-G stabilizes conformational states prone to translocation and promotes a conformational rearrangement of the ribosome (unlocking) that accelerates the rate-limiting step of translocation: the movement of the tRNA anticodons on the small ribosomal subunit. EF-G acts as a Brownian ratchet providing directional bias for movement at the cost of GTP hydrolysis.},

abstract = {The molecular mechanisms by which tRNA molecules enter and transit the ribosome during mRNA translation remains elusive. However, recent genetic, biochemical and structural studies offer important new findings into the ordered sequence of events underpinning the translocation process that help place the molecular mechanism within reach. In particular, new structural and kinetic insights have been obtained regarding tRNA movements through 'hybrid state' configurations. These dynamic views reveal that the macromolecular ribosome particle, like many smaller proteins, has an intrinsic capacity to reversibly sample an ensemble of similarly stable native states. Such perspectives suggest that substrates, factors and environmental cues contribute to translation regulation by helping the dynamic system navigate through a highly complex and metastable energy landscape.},

abstract = {An aerobic, Gram-negative bacterial isolate, strain DSM 19503(T), was isolated from haemolymph serum of the blacklip abalone Haliotis rubra. Cells of strain DSM 19503(T) were vibrioid to spiral, motile and were able to pass through sterile filters with a pore size of 0.2 microm, indicating the small width of the bacterium. The isolate was psychrophilic, with the ability to grow at 2-8 degrees C. Oxidase activity was present, whereas catalase activity was absent. The nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain DSM 19503(T) was obtained and phylogenetic sequence analysis showed that it formed a distinct genus in the family Oceanospirillaceae with highest sequence similarity of 92.9\% to Oleispira antarctica RB-8(T). The cellular fatty acid composition was dependent on the growth medium used for cultivation. During growth on seawater agar, the fatty acid composition was most similar to that of Oleispira antarctica DSM 14852(T), with mainly C(16:0) (90.3\%). In contrast, Columbia blood agar/NaCl-grown cells exhibited mainly C(10:0) 3-OH (11.8\%), C(12:1)cis5 (8.2\%), C(16:1)cis9 (29.6\%), C(16:0) (19.3\%) and C(18:1)cis9 (13.1\%) fatty acids. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic data, strain DSM 19503(T) is considered to represent a novel species in a new genus for which the name Oceaniserpentilla haliotis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Oceaniserpentilla haliotis is DSM 19503(T) (=LMG 24225(T)).},

It is generally assumed that there exists no simple ultimatum strategy whereby one player can enforce a unilateral claim to an unfair share of rewards. Here, we show that such strategies unexpectedly do exist. In particular, a player X who is witting of these strategies can (i) deterministically set her opponent Y's score, independently of his strategy or response, or (ii) enforce an extortionate linear relation between her and his scores. Against such a player, an evolutionary player's best response is to accede to the extortion. Only a player with a theory of mind about his opponent can do better, in which case Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is an Ultimatum Game.},

Electrostatic and hydrodynamic models of eIF4E protein and the ligands were prepared using established molecular electrostatics and hydrodynamics simulation methods for predicting ionization states of titratable groups, adequate for given experimental conditions, and for computing their translational and rotational diffusion tensors, respectively. The diffusional encounter rate constants obtained from simulations are compared with bimolecular association rate constants resulting from stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter measurements. A very good agreement between simulations and experiments was achieved, which indicates that the kinetics of binding 5'-mRNA caps can be satisfactory explained by referring to the Brownian motion of the particles with the electrostatic steering of the ligands toward the eIF4E binding site and electrostatic desolvation contributions upon complex formation.},

@article{Sheridan1999,
abstract = {Negative DNA superhelicity can destabilize the local B-form DNA structure and can drive transitions to other conformations at susceptible sites. In a molecule containing multiple susceptible sites, superhelicity can couple these alternatives together, causing them to compete. In principle, these superhelically driven local structural transitions can be either facilitated or inhibited by proteins that bind at or near potential transition sites. If a DNA region that is susceptible to forming a superhelically induced alternate structure is stabilized in the B-form by a DNA-binding protein, its propensity for transition will be transferred to other sites within the same domain. If one of these secondary sites is in a promoter region, this transfer could facilitate open complex formation and thereby activate gene expression. We previously proposed that a supercoiling-dependent, DNA structural transmission mechanism of this type is responsible for the integration host factor-mediated activation of transcription from the ilvPG promoter of Escherichia coli (Sheridan, S. D., Benham, C. J. \& Hatfield, G. W. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 21298-21308). In this report we confirm the validity of this mechanism by demonstrating the ability of a distant Z-DNA-forming site to compete with the superhelical destabilization that is required for integration host factor-mediated transcriptional activation, and thereby delay its occurrence.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs have been implicated in regulating diverse cellular pathways. Although there is emerging evidence that some microRNAs can function as oncogenes or tumour suppressors, the role of microRNAs in mediating cancer metastasis remains unexplored. Here we show, using a combination of mouse and human cells, that microRNA-10b (miR-10b) is highly expressed in metastatic breast cancer cells and positively regulates cell migration and invasion. Overexpression of miR-10b in otherwise non-metastatic breast tumours initiates robust invasion and metastasis. Expression of miR-10b is induced by the transcription factor Twist, which binds directly to the putative promoter of mir-10b (MIRN10B). The miR-10b induced by Twist proceeds to inhibit translation of the messenger RNA encoding homeobox D10, resulting in increased expression of a well-characterized pro-metastatic gene, RHOC. Significantly, the level of miR-10b expression in primary breast carcinomas correlates with clinical progression. These findings suggest the workings of an undescribed regulatory pathway, in which a pleiotropic transcription factor induces expression of a specific microRNA, which suppresses its direct target and in turn activates another pro-metastatic gene, leading to tumour cell invasion and metastasis.},

abstract = {Structural results with minor groove binding agents, such as netropsin, have provided detailed, atomic level views of DNA molecular recognition. Solution studies, however, indicate that there is complexity in the binding of minor groove agents to a single site. Netropsin, for example, has two DNA binding enthalpies in isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments that indicate the compound simultaneously forms two thermodynamically different complexes at a single AATT site. Two proposals for the origin of this unusual observation have been developed: (i) two different bound species of netropsin at single binding sites and (ii) a netropsin induced DNA hairpin to duplex transition. To develop a better understanding of DNA recognition complexity, the two proposals have been tested with several DNAs and the methods of mass spectrometry (MS), polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in addition to ITC. All of the methods with all of the DNAs investigated clearly shows that netropsin forms two different complexes at AATT sites, and that the proposal for an induced hairpin to duplex transition in this system is incorrect.},

abstract = {Selenocysteine (Sec) is the "21st" amino acid and is genetically encoded by an unusual incorporation system. The stop codon UGA becomes a Sec codon when the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) exists downstream of UGA. Sec incorporation requires a specific elongation factor, SelB, which recognizes tRNA(Sec) via use of an EF-Tu-like domain and the SECIS mRNA hairpin via use of a C-terminal domain (SelB-C). SelB functions in multiple translational steps: binding to SECIS mRNA and tRNA(Sec), delivery of tRNA(Sec) onto an A site, GTP hydrolysis, and release from tRNA and mRNA. However, this dynamic mechanism remains to be revealed. Here, we report a large domain rearrangement in the structure of SelB-C complexed with RNA. Surprisingly, the interdomain region forms new interactions with the phosphate backbone of a neighboring RNA, distinct from SECIS RNA binding. This SelB-RNA interaction is sequence independent, possibly reflecting SelB-tRNA/-rRNA recognitions. Based on these data, the dynamic SelB-ribosome-mRNA-tRNA interactions will be discussed.},

Multiple pathways for srRNA biogenesis and diverse mechanisms of gene regulation may indicate that srRNA regulation evolved independently multiple times. However, small RNA pathways share numerous properties, including the ability of a single srRNA to regulate multiple targets. Some of the mechanisms of gene regulation by srRNAs have significant effect on the abundance of free srRNAs that are ready to interact with new targets. This results in indirect interactions among seemingly unrelated genes, as well as in a crosstalk between different srRNA pathways. Here we briefly review and compare the major srRNA pathways, and argue that the impact of srRNA is always at the system level. We demonstrate how a simple mathematical model can ease the discussion of governing principles. To demonstrate these points we review a few examples from bacteria and animals.},

Among the A-minors found in 16S rRNA are a set of interactions between adenosines at positions 1433, 1434 and 1468 in helix 44 (h44) and their receptors in the nucleotide 320-340 region of helix 13 (h13). These interactions have been implicated in the maintenance of translational accuracy, because base substitutions at the adjacent C1469 increase miscoding errors. We have tested their functional significance through mutagenesis of h13 and h44. Mutations at the h44 A residues, or the A-minor receptors in h13, increase a variety of translational errors and a subset of the mutants show decreased association between 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits. These results are consistent with the involvement of h13-h44 interactions in the alignment and packing of these helices in the 30S subunit and the importance of this helical alignment for tRNA selection and subunit-subunit interaction.},

abstract = {Polymyxin, a long-known peptide antibiotic, has recently been reintroduced in clinical practice because it is sometimes the only available antibiotic for the treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. Lack of information on the biosynthetic genes of polymyxin, however, has limited the study of structure-function relationships and the development of improved polymyxins. During whole genome sequencing of Paenibacillus polymyxa E681, a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium, we identified a gene cluster encoding polymyxin synthetase. Here, we report the complete sequence of the gene cluster and its function in polymyxin biosynthesis. The gene cluster spanning the 40.6-kb region consists of five open reading frames, designated pmxA, pmxB, pmxC, pmxD, and pmxE. The pmxC and pmxD genes are similar to genes that encode transport proteins, while pmxA, pmxB, and pmxE encode polymyxin synthetases. The insertional disruption of pmxE led to a loss of the ability to produce polymyxin. Introduction of the pmx gene cluster into the amyE locus of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome resulted in the production of polymyxin in the presence of extracellularly added L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the pmx gene cluster is responsible for polymyxin biosynthesis.},

abstract = {A Gram-negative and tryptophanase-positive thermophile, whose growth is dependent on co-culture with an associating Bacillus strain, had been reported and tentatively named Symbiobacterium thermophilum strain T(T). Axenic culture of strain T(T) was recently established by dialysing cultures with the supporting bacterial strains or adding their culture broth. Phylogenetic analysis of strain T(T), based on the 16S rDNA sequence, was conducted for the validation of S. thermophilum. The sequence of strain T(T) was located at the outermost position in the high-G+C Gram-positive group distinctly isolated from any other branches hitherto known. Ten sequences identical to that of strain T(T), and one sequence closely related to it, were identified for the first time from soil and compost samples. The outer membrane of strain T(T) had a three-layered structure, outside the cytoplasmic membrane, which is similar to the S-layer in the cells of members of the Bacillaceae. Chemical analysis of the cells revealed that menaquinone-6 is a major component of the quinone system. According to these results, along with several previous observations (i.e. a G+C DNA content of 65 mol\% and the identification of iso-C15:0 and iso-C17:0 acids as major cellular fatty acids), the new taxon Symbiobacterium thermophilum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is S. thermophilum strain T(T) (= IAM 14863T).},

@article{Omelchenko2005,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thermus thermophilus and Deinococcus radiodurans belong to a distinct bacterial clade but have remarkably different phenotypes. T. thermophilus is a thermophile, which is relatively sensitive to ionizing radiation and desiccation, whereas D. radiodurans is a mesophile, which is highly radiation- and desiccation-resistant. Here we present an in-depth comparison of the genomes of these two related but differently adapted bacteria. RESULTS: By reconstructing the evolution of Thermus and Deinococcus after the divergence from their common ancestor, we demonstrate a high level of post-divergence gene flux in both lineages. Various aspects of the adaptation to high temperature in Thermus can be attributed to horizontal gene transfer from archaea and thermophilic bacteria; many of the horizontally transferred genes are located on the single megaplasmid of Thermus. In addition, the Thermus lineage has lost a set of genes that are still present in Deinococcus and many other mesophilic bacteria but are not common among thermophiles. By contrast, Deinococcus seems to have acquired numerous genes related to stress response systems from various bacteria. A comparison of the distribution of orthologous genes among the four partitions of the Deinococcus genome and the two partitions of the Thermus genome reveals homology between the Thermus megaplasmid (pTT27) and Deinococcus megaplasmid (DR177). CONCLUSION: After the radiation from their common ancestor, the Thermus and Deinococcus lineages have taken divergent paths toward their distinct lifestyles. In addition to extensive gene loss, Thermus seems to have acquired numerous genes from thermophiles, which likely was the decisive contribution to its thermophilic adaptation. By contrast, Deinococcus lost few genes but seems to have acquired many bacterial genes that apparently enhanced its ability to survive different kinds of environmental stresses. Notwithstanding the accumulation of horizontally transferred genes, we also show that the single megaplasmid of Thermus and the DR177 megaplasmid of Deinococcus are homologous and probably were inherited from the common ancestor of these bacteria.},

The overall quadruplex scaffold can exhibit several morphologies through intramolecular or intermolecular organization of G-rich oligodeoxyribonucleic acid strands. In particular, several G-rich strands can form higher order assemblies by multimerization between several G-quadruplex units. Here, we report on the identification of a novel dimerization pathway. Our Nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism, UV, gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry studies on the DNA sequence dCGGTGGT demonstrate that this sequence forms an octamer when annealed in presence of K(+) or NH(4)(+) ions, through the 5'-5' stacking of two tetramolecular G-quadruplex subunits via unusual G(:C):G(:C):G(:C):G(:C) octads.},

abstract = {The Antarctic continent harbors a range of specialized and sometimes highly localized microbial biotopes. These include biotopes associated with desiccated mineral soils, rich ornithogenic soils, glacial and sea ice, ice-covered lakes, translucent rocks, and geothermally heated soils. All are characterized by the imposition of one or more environmental extremes (including low temperature, wide temperature fluctuations, desiccation, hypersalinity, high periodic radiation fluxes, and low nutrient status). As our understanding of the true microbial diversity in these biotopes expands from the application of molecular phylogenetic methods, we come closer to the point where we can make an accurate assessment of the impacts of environmental change, human intervention, and other natural and unnatural impositions. At present, it is possible to make reasonable predictions about the physical effects of local climate change, but only general predictions on possible changes in microbial community structure. The consequences of some direct human impacts, such as physical disruption of microbial soil communities, are obvious if not yet quantitated. Others, such as the dissemination of nonindigenous microorganisms into indigenous microbial communities, are not yet understood.},

abstract = {Information theory was used to build a promoter model that accounts for the -10, the -35 and the uncertainty of the gap between them on a common scale. Helical face assignment indicated that base -7, rather than -11, of the -10 may be flipping to initiate transcription. We found that the sequence conservation of sigma70 binding sites is 6.5 +/- 0.1 bits. Some promoters lack a -35 region, but have a 6.7 +/- 0.2 bit extended -10, almost the same information as the bipartite promoter. These results and similarities between the contacts in the extended -10 binding and the -35 suggest that the flexible bipartite sigma factor evolved from a simpler polymerase. Binding predicted by the bipartite model is enriched around 35 bases upstream of the translational start. This distance is the smallest 5' mRNA leader necessary for ribosome binding, suggesting that selective pressure minimizes transcript length. The promoter model was combined with models of the transcription factors Fur and Lrp to locate new promoters, to quantify promoter strengths, and to predict activation and repression. Finally, the DNA-bending proteins Fis, H-NS and IHF frequently have sites within one DNA persistence length from the -35, so bending allows distal activators to reach the polymerase.},

@article{Kozak1986,
abstract = {Oligonucleotides designed to create hairpin structures were inserted upstream from the ATG initiator codon in several plasmids that encode preproinsulin, and the effects on translation were monitored in COS cells transfected by the vectors. Creation of a hairpin (delta G = -30 kcal/mol) that directly involves the ATG triplet at the start of the preproinsulin coding sequence does not reduce the yield of proinsulin. However, a more stable stem-and-loop structure (delta G = -50 kcal/mol) reduces the proinsulin yield by 85-95\%. The stable hairpin inhibits even when it occurs at the midpoint of the 5' untranslated sequence and thus involves neither the cap nor the ATG codon. Presumably the migrating 40S ribosomal subunit can melt moderately stable duplexes but stalls at structures (delta G = -50 kcal/mol) that resist unfolding. Other experiments argue against the idea that sequestering the 5'-proximal ATG codon in a hairpin structure might allow it to be skipped by ribosomes in favor of an exposed ATG triplet farther downstream: when the primary sequence around the first ATG triplet is favorable for initiation, no translation from a downstream site can be detected, irrespective of whether the first ATG codon is single-stranded or base-paired.},

abstract = {Temperature is among the most important of the parameters that free-living microbes monitor. Microbial physiology needs to be readjusted in response to sudden temperature changes. When the ambient temperature rises or drops to potentially harmful levels, cells mount protective stress responses--so-called heat or cold shock responses, respectively. Pathogenic microorganisms often respond to a temperature of around 37 degrees C by inducing virulence gene expression. There are two main ways in which temperature can be measured. Often, the consequences of a sudden temperature shift are detected. Such indirect signals are known to be the accumulation of denatured proteins (heat shock) or stalled ribosomes (cold shock). However, this article focuses solely on direct thermosensors. Since the conformation of virtually every biomolecule is susceptible to temperature changes, primary sensors include DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids.},

Aimed at a better understanding of the evolution of the E. coli O157:H7 pathogenome, the present study presents the high-quality sequencing and comparative phylogenomic analysis of a comprehensive panel of 25 E. coli O157:H7 strains associated with three nearly simultaneous food-borne outbreaks of human disease in the United States. Here we present a population genetic analysis of more than 200 related strains recovered from patients, contaminated produce, and zoonotic sources. High-resolution phylogenomic approaches allow the dynamics of pathogenome evolution to be followed at a high level of phylogenetic accuracy and resolution. SNP discovery and study of genome architecture and prophage content identified numerous biomarkers to assess the extent of genetic diversity within a set of clinical and environmental strains. A total of 1,225 SNPs were identified in the present study and are now available for typing of the E. coli O157:H7 lineage. These data should prove useful for the development of a refined phylogenomic framework for forensic, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies to define better risk in response to novel and emerging E. coli O157:H7 resistance and virulence phenotypes.},

In phylogenetic analysis using neighbour-joining, maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood, strains from surface seawater were inferred to be located in the Halomonas aquamarina-meridiana clade within the family Halomonadaceae. Strains from deep seawater (5000-6000 m), however, formed a novel monophyletic clade within the Moraxella-Psychrobacter branch in the family Moraxellaceae, showing separation from terrestrial and Antarctic relatives. These deep-sea strains were also discriminated from other known Psychrobacter species in phenotype, e.g. limited growth in the absence of NaCl (optimum at about 3\% NaCl), positive urease activity, acid production from xylose and arabinose, and the presence of multiple fimbriae. DNA relatedness values among six deep-sea strains were > 85\% in DNA-DNA hybridization experiments and > 98\% in aligned 16S rDNA sequences. From this evidence, a new species, Psychrobacter pacificensis, is proposed for these deep-sea psychrophiles; the type strain of Psychrobacter pacificensis is strain NIBH P2K6T (= IFO 16270T). Occurrence of psychrobacters in cold Japan Trench deep seawater and at the Antarctic sea surface suggests that deep-sea bacterial habitation and evolution have been mediated by global deep-ocean circulation linked to the sinking of cooled seawater in polar regions.},

abstract = {Epitopes are antigenic determinants that are useful because they induce B-cell antibody production and stimulate T-cell activation. Bioinformatics can enable rapid, efficient prediction of potential epitopes. Here, we designed a novel B-cell linear epitope prediction system called LEPS, Linear Epitope Prediction by Propensities and Support Vector Machine, that combined physico-chemical propensity identification and support vector machine (SVM) classification. We tested the LEPS on four datasets: AntiJen, HIV, a newly generated PC, and AHP, a combination of these three datasets. Peptides with globally or locally high physicochemical propensities were first identified as primitive linear epitope (LE) candidates. Then, candidates were classified with the SVM based on the unique features of amino acid segments. This reduced the number of predicted epitopes and enhanced the positive prediction value (PPV). Compared to four other well-known LE prediction systems, the LEPS achieved the highest accuracy (72.52\%), specificity (84.22\%), PPV (32.07\%), and Matthews' correlation coefficient (10.36\%).},

The accurate prediction of different RNA higher-order structures from their nucleic acid sequences will provide insight into their functions and molecular mechanics. We have been determining statistical potentials for a collection of structural elements that is larger than the number of structural elements determined with experimentally determined energy values. The experimentally derived free energies and the statistical potentials for canonical base-pair stacks are analogous, demonstrating that statistical potentials derived from comparative data can be used as an alternative energetic parameter. A new computational infrastructure-RNA Comparative Analysis Database (rCAD)-that utilizes a relational database was developed to manipulate and analyze very large sequence alignments and secondary-structure data sets. Using rCAD, we determined a richer set of energetic parameters for RNA fundamental structural elements including hairpin and internal loops. A new version of RNAfold was developed to utilize these statistical potentials. Overall, these new statistical potentials for hairpin and internal loops integrated into the new version of RNAfold demonstrated significant improvements in the prediction accuracy of RNA secondary structure.},

abstract = {The spliceosome is a dynamic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) machine that catalyzes the removal of introns during the two transesterification steps of eukaryotic pre-mRNA splicing. Here we used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor the distance of the 5' splice site (5' SS) and branch point (BP) of pre-mRNA in affinity-purified spliceosomes stalled by a mutation in the DExD/H-box helicase Prp2 immediately before the first splicing step. Addition of recombinant Prp2 together with NTP and protein cofactor Spp2 rearranges the spliceosome-substrate complex to reversibly explore conformations with proximal 5' SS and BP that accommodate chemistry. Addition of Cwc25, a small heat-stable splicing factor, then strongly biases this equilibrium toward the proximal conformation, promoting efficient first-step splicing. The spliceosome thus functions as a biased Brownian ratchet machine where a helicase unlocks thermal fluctuations subsequently rectified by a cofactor 'pawl', a principle possibly widespread among the many helicase-driven RNPs.},

abstract = {Right-handed RNA duplexes of (CG)n sequence undergo salt-induced helicity reversal, forming left-handed RNA double helices (Z-RNA). In contrast to the thoroughly studied Z-DNA, no Z-RNA structure of natural origin is known. Here we report the NMR structure of a half-turn, left-handed RNA helix (CGCGCG)2 determined in 6 M NaClO4. This is the first nucleic acid motif determined at such high salt. Sequential assignments of non-exchangeable proton resonances of the Z-form were based on the hitherto unreported NOE connectivity path [H6(n)-H5'/H5''(n)-H8(n+1)-H1'(n+1)-H6(n+2)] found for left-handed helices. Z-RNA structure shows several conformational features significantly different from Z-DNA. Intra-strand but no inter-strand base stacking was observed for both CpG and GpC steps. Helical twist angles for CpG steps have small positive values (4-7 degrees), whereas GpC steps have large negative values (-61 degrees). In the full-turn model of Z-RNA (12.4 bp per turn), base pairs are much closer to the helix axis than in Z-DNA, thus both the very deep, narrow minor groove with buried cytidine 2'-OH groups, and the major groove are well defined. The 2'-OH group of cytidines plays a crucial role in the Z-RNA structure and its formation; 2'-O-methylation of cytidine, but not of guanosine residues prohibits A to Z helicity reversal.},

The H-2Kb complexes were refined at 2.3 A for VSV-8 and 2.5 A for SEV-9. The structure of H-2Kb exhibits a high degree of similarity with human HLA class I, although the individual domains can have slightly altered dispositions. Both peptides bind in extended conformations with most of their surfaces buried in the H-2Kb binding groove. The nonamer peptide maintains the same amino- and carboxyl-terminal interactions as the octamer primarily by the insertion of a bulge in the center of an otherwise beta conformation. Most of the specific interactions are between side-chain atoms of H-2Kb and main-chain atoms of peptide. This binding scheme accounts in large part for the enormous diversity of peptide sequences that bind with high affinity to class I molecules. Small but significant conformational changes in H-2Kb are associated with peptide binding, and these synergistic movements may be an integral part of the T cell receptor recognition process.},

The novel isolate, designated T-22(T), formed rod-shaped cells, was catalase- and oxidase-positive and tolerated up to 300 mM boron. The strain also survived on agar medium containing up to 3 \% (w/v) NaCl. The pH range for growth of this strain was 6.5-10.0 (optimum pH 8.0-9.0) and the temperature range was 16-37 degrees C (optimum 28-30 degrees C). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed a clear affiliation with the genus Chimaereicella, with 97.4 \% sequence similarity to Chimaereicella alkaliphila AC-74(T), which was the highest similarity among cultivated bacteria. The DNA-DNA relatedness with C. alkaliphila AC-74(T) was 28.3 \%. The major respiratory quinone system was MK-7 and the predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(17 : 1)omega9c, iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH and summed feature 3 (iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH and/or iso-C(16 : 1)omega7c). The DNA G+C content was 42.5 mol\%. Based on the phylogenetic analysis and physiological, chemotaxonomic and genetic data, we concluded that strain T-22(T) should be classified in the genus Chimaereicella, and we propose the name Chimaereicella boritolerans sp. nov. for this novel species. The type strain is strain T-22(T) (=DSM 17298(T)=NBRC 101277(T)=ATCC BAA-1189(T)).},

abstract = {In the ocean's most extreme depths, pressures of 70 to 110 megapascals prevent the growth of all but the most hyperpiezophilic (pressure-loving) organisms. The physiological adaptations required for growth under these conditions are considered to be substantial. Efforts to determine specific adaptations permitting growth at extreme pressures have thus far focused on relatively few gamma-proteobacteria, in part due to the technical difficulties of obtaining piezophilic bacteria in pure culture. Here, we present the molecular phylogenies of several new piezophiles of widely differing geographic origins. Included are results from an analysis of the first deep-trench bacterial isolates recovered from the southern hemisphere (9.9-km depth) and of the first gram-positive piezophilic strains. These new data allowed both phylogenetic and structural 16S rRNA comparisons among deep-ocean trench piezophiles and closely related strains not adapted to high pressure. Our results suggest that (i) the Circumpolar Deep Water acts as repository for hyperpiezophiles and drives their dissemination to deep trenches in the Pacific Ocean and (ii) the occurrence of elongated helices in the 16S rRNA genes increases with the extent of adaptation to growth at elevated pressure. These helix changes are believed to improve ribosome function under deep-sea conditions.},

abstract = {A computer model is described for studying the kinetics of the self-assembly of icosahedral viral capsids. Solution of this problem is crucial to an understanding of the viral life cycle, which currently cannot be adequately addressed through laboratory techniques. The abstract simulation model employed to address this is based on the local rules theory of. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 91:7732-7736). It is shown that the principle of local rules, generalized with a model of kinetics and other extensions, can be used to simulate complicated problems in self-assembly. This approach allows for a computationally tractable molecular dynamics-like simulation of coat protein interactions while retaining many relevant features of capsid self-assembly. Three simple simulation experiments are presented to illustrate the use of this model. These show the dependence of growth and malformation rates on the energetics of binding interactions, the tolerance of errors in binding positions, and the concentration of subunits in the examples. These experiments demonstrate a tradeoff within the model between growth rate and fidelity of assembly for the three parameters. A detailed discussion of the computational model is also provided.},

abstract = {Here, we report a long-distance interaction (LDI) as a critical regulator of alternative splicing of Survival Motor Neuron 2 (SMN2) exon 7, skipping of which is linked to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a leading genetic disease of children and infants. We show that this LDI is linked to a unique intra-intronic structure that we term internal stem through LDI-1 (ISTL1). We used site-specific mutations and Selective 2'-Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension to confirm the formation and functional significance of ISTL1. We demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of ISTL1 is independent of hnRNP A1/A2B1 and PTB1 previously implicated in SMN2 exon 7 splicing. We show that an antisense oligonucleotide-mediated sequestration of the 3' strand of ISTL1 fully corrects SMN2 exon 7 splicing and restores high levels of SMN and Gemin2, a SMN-interacting protein, in SMA patient cells. Our results also reveal that the 3' strand of ISTL1 and upstream sequences constitute an inhibitory region that we term intronic splicing silencer N2 (ISS-N2). This is the first report to demonstrate a critical role of a structure-associated LDI in splicing regulation of an essential gene linked to a genetic disease. Our findings expand the repertoire of potential targets for an antisense oligonucleotide-mediated therapy of SMA.},

abstract = {Three base pairs in the T-stem are primarily responsible for the sequence-specific interaction of tRNA with Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus EF-Tu. While the amino acids on the surface of EF-Tu that contact aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) are highly conserved among bacteria, the T-stem sequences of individual tRNA are variable, making it unclear whether or not this protein-nucleic acid interaction is also sequence specific in other bacteria. We propose and validate a thermodynamic model that predicts the $\Delta$G° of any tRNA to EF-Tu using the sequence of its three T-stem base pairs. Despite dramatic differences in T-stem sequences, the predicted $\Delta$G° values for the majority of tRNA classes are similar in all bacteria and closely match the $\Delta$G° values determined for E. coli tRNAs. Each individual tRNA class has evolved to have a characteristic $\Delta$G° value to EF-Tu, but different T-stem sequences are used to achieve this $\Delta$G° value in different bacteria. Thus, the compensatory relationship between the affinity of the tRNA body and the affinity of the esterified amino acid is universal among bacteria. Additionally, we predict and validate a small number of aa-tRNAs that bind more weakly to EF-Tu than expected and thus are candidates for acting as activated amino acid donors in processes outside of translation.},

The health and economic implications of mortality reduction have been given substantial attention, but the observed malleability of human mortality has not been placed in a broad evolutionary context. We quantify the rate and amount of mortality reduction by comparing a variety of human populations to the evolved human mortality profile, here estimated as the average mortality pattern for ethnographically observed hunter-gatherers. We show that human mortality has decreased so substantially that the difference between hunter-gatherers and today's lowest mortality populations is greater than the difference between hunter-gatherers and wild chimpanzees. The bulk of this mortality reduction has occurred since 1900 and has been experienced by only about 4 of the roughly 8,000 human generations that have ever lived. Moreover, mortality improvement in humans is on par with or greater than the reductions in mortality in other species achieved by laboratory selection experiments and endocrine pathway mutations. This observed plasticity in age-specific risk of death is at odds with conventional theories of aging.},

We show that the 5'UTR of the mgtA gene can adopt different stem-loop structures depending on the Mg(2+) levels, which determine whether transcription reads through into the mgtA coding region or stops within the 5'UTR. We could recapitulate the Mg(2+)-regulated transcription using a defined in vitro transcription system with RNA polymerase as the only protein component. The initiation of mgtA transcription responds to extracytoplasmic Mg(2+) and its elongation into the coding region to cytoplasmic Mg(2+), providing a singular example in which the same ligand is sensed in different cellular compartments to regulate disparate steps in gene transcription.},

Recent research on many different bacterial species has now shown that the final stage in this life cycle includes the production and release of differentiated dispersal cells. The formation of these cells and their eventual dispersal is initiated through diverse and remarkably sophisticated mechanisms, suggesting that there are strong evolutionary pressures for dispersal from an otherwise largely sessile biofilm. The evolutionary aspect of biofilm dispersal is now being explored through the integration of molecular microbiology with eukaryotic ecological and evolutionary theory, which provides a broad conceptual framework for the diversity of specific mechanisms underlying biofilm dispersal. Here, we review recent progress in this emerging field and suggest that the merging of detailed molecular mechanisms with ecological theory will significantly advance our understanding of biofilm biology and ecology.},

Each 30-130 microm long seta is only one-tenth the diameter of a human hair and contains hundreds of projections terminating in 0.2-0.5 microm spatula-shaped structures. After nearly a century of anatomical description, here we report the first direct measurements of single setal force by using a two-dimensional micro-electromechanical systems force sensor and a wire as a force gauge. Measurements revealed that a seta is ten times more effective at adhesion than predicted from maximal estimates on whole animals. Adhesive force values support the hypothesis that individual seta operate by van der Waals forces. The gecko's peculiar behaviour of toe uncurling and peeling led us to discover two aspects of setal function which increase their effectiveness. A unique macroscopic orientation and preloading of the seta increased attachment force 600-fold above that of frictional measurements of the material. Suitably orientated setae reduced the forces necessary to peel the toe by simply detaching above a critical angle with the substratum.},

abstract = {The 30S ribosomal subunit has two primary functions in protein synthesis. It discriminates against aminoacyl transfer RNAs that do not match the codon of messenger RNA, thereby ensuring accuracy in translation of the genetic message in a process called decoding. Also, it works with the 50S subunit to move the tRNAs and associated mRNA by precisely one codon, in a process called translocation. Here we describe the functional implications of the high-resolution 30S crystal structure presented in the accompanying paper, and infer details of the interactions between the 30S subunit and its tRNA and mRNA ligands. We also describe the crystal structure of the 30S subunit complexed with the antibiotics paromomycin, streptomycin and spectinomycin, which interfere with decoding and translocation. This work reveals the structural basis for the action of these antibiotics, and leads to a model for the role of the universally conserved 16S RNA residues A1492 and A1493 in the decoding process.},

abstract = {Decapping represents a critical control point in regulating expression of protein coding genes. Here, we demonstrate that decapping also modulates expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Specifically, levels of >100 lncRNAs in yeast are controlled by decapping and are degraded by a pathway that occurs independent of decapping regulators. We find many lncRNAs degraded by DCP2 are expressed proximal to inducible genes. Of these, we show several genes required for galactose utilization are associated with lncRNAs that have expression patterns inversely correlated with their mRNA counterpart. Moreover, decapping of these lncRNAs is critical for rapid and robust induction of GAL gene expression. Failure to destabilize a lncRNA known to exert repressive histone modifications results in perpetuation of a repressive chromatin state that contributes to reduced plasticity of gene activation. We propose that decapping and lncRNA degradation serve a vital role in transcriptional regulation specifically at inducible genes.},

abstract = {Recently, a new procedure was developed which allowed for the first time the isolation of a hyperthermophilic archaeum tracked by 165 rRNA analysis from a terrestrial hot solfataric spring ('Obsidian Pool', Yellowstone National Park, WY, USA). This novel isolate is characterized here. Cells are round cocci with a diameter of 0.2-0.8 micron, occurring singly, in pairs, short chains and in grape-like aggregates. The aggregates exhibit a weak bluish-green fluorescence under UV radiation at 420 nm. The new isolate is an anaerobic obligate heterotroph, using preferentially yeast extract for growth. The metabolic products include CO2, H2, acetate and isovalerate. Growth is observed between 65 and 90 degrees C (optimum: 85 degrees C), from pH 5.0 to 7.0 (optimum: 6.5) and up to 0.7\% NaCl. The apparent activation energy for growth is about 149 kJ mol-1. Elemental sulfur or hydrogen inhibits growth. The core lipids consist mainly of acyclic and cyclic glycerol diphytanyl tetraethers. The cell envelope contains a cytoplasmic membrane covered by an amorphous layer of unknown composition; there is no evidence for a regularly arrayed surface-layer protein. The G + C content is 46 mol\%. On the basis of 165 rRNA sequence comparisons in combination with morphological, physiological and biochemical properties, the isolate represents a new genus within the Desulfurococcaceae, which has been named Thermosphaera. The type species is Thermosphaera aggregans, the type strain is isolate M11TLT (= DSM 11486T).},

abstract = {The yeast poly(A) RNA binding protein, Nab2, facilitates poly(A) tail length regulation together with targeting transcripts to nuclear pores and their export to the cytoplasm. Nab2 binds polyadenosine RNA primarily through a tandem repeat of CCCH Zn fingers. We report here the 2.15 \AA resolution crystal structure of Zn fingers 3-5 of Chaetomium thermophilum Nab2 bound to polyadenosine RNA and establish the structural basis for the molecular recognition of adenosine ribonucleotides. Zn fingers 3 and 5 each bind two adenines, whereas finger 4 binds only one. In each case, the purine ring binds in a surface groove, where it stacks against an aromatic side chain, with specificity being provided by a novel pattern of H-bonds, most commonly between purine N6 and a Zn-coordinated cysteine supplemented by H-bonds between purine N7 and backbone amides. Residues critical for adenine binding are conserved between species and provide a code that allows prediction of finger-binding stoichiometry based on their sequence. Moreover, these results indicate that, in addition to poly(A) tails, Nab2 can also recognize sequence motifs elsewhere in transcripts in which adenosines are placed at key positions, consistent with its function in mRNP organization and compaction as well as poly(A) tail length regulation.},

abstract = {For almost 20 years crystallographers have sought to solve the structure of the ribosome, the largest and most complicated RNA-protein complex in the cell. All ribosomes are composed of a large and small subunit which for the humble bacterial ribosome comprise more than 4000 ribonucleotides, 54 different proteins, and have a molecular mass totaling over 2.5 million Daltons. The past few years have seen the resolution of structures at the atomic level for both large and small subunits and of the complete 70S ribosome from Thermus thermophilus at a resolution of 5.5-A. Soaking of small ligands (such as antibiotics, substrate analogues, and small translational factors) into the crystals of the subunits has revolutionized our understanding of the central functions of the ribosome. Coupled with the power of cryo-electron microscopic studies of translation complexes, a collection of snap-shots is accumulating, which can be assembled to create a likely motion picture of the bacterial ribosome during translation. Recent analyses show yeast ribosomes have a remarkable structural similarity to bacterial ribosomes. This Review aims to follow the bacterial ribosome through each sequential "frame" of the translation cycle, emphasizing at each point the features that are found in all organisms.},

abstract = {Three Gram-negative, non-motile, non-pigmented, oxidase-positive coccobacilli capable of growth at temperatures from -10 to 30 degrees C and salinities of 0 to 1.7 M NaCl were isolated from Siberian permafrost and characterized. Both 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequencing studies placed the isolates in the Gammaproteobacteria within the genus Psychrobacter. However, with higher bootstrap values and reproducible tree topologies, gyrB represented a more reliable phylogenetic marker for the taxonomy of Psychrobacter species. DNA-DNA hybridization data supported gyrB tree topologies and established two relatedness groups within the three isolates; neither of these groups was related at the species level to any previously described Psychrobacter species. The two groups of isolates could be differentiated phenotypically from 13 previously described Psychrobacter species using API strips. These results support the existence of two novel species of Psychrobacter, for which we propose the names Psychrobacter cryohalolentis sp. nov.

The same principle is used in laboratory to extend the natural biodiversity to obtain better catalysts for applications in biomanufacturing or for improved biopharmaceuticals. Furthermore, single mutation in genes of drug-metabolizing enzymes can also result in dramatic changes in pharmacokinetics. These changes are a major cause of patient-specific drug responses and are, therefore, the molecular basis for personalized medicine. MuteinDB systematically links laboratory-generated enzyme variants (muteins) and natural isoforms with their biochemical properties including kinetic data of catalyzed reactions. Detailed information about kinetic characteristics of muteins is available in a systematic way and searchable for known mutations and catalyzed reactions as well as their substrates and known products. MuteinDB is broadly applicable to any known protein and their variants and makes mutagenesis and biochemical data searchable and comparable in a simple and easy-to-use manner. For the import of new mutein data, a simple, standardized, spreadsheet-based data format has been defined. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the MuteinDB, first data sets have been incorporated for selected cytochrome P450 enzymes as well as for nitrilases and peroxidases.

Yeast prions might provide a mechanism for generating heritable phenotypic diversity that promotes survival in fluctuating environments and the evolution of new traits. However, this hypothesis is highly controversial. Prions that create new traits have not been found in wild strains, leading to the perception that they are rare 'diseases' of laboratory cultivation. Here we biochemically test approximately 700 wild strains of Saccharomyces for [PSI(+)] or [MOT3(+)], and find these prions in many. They conferred diverse phenotypes that were frequently beneficial under selective conditions. Simple meiotic re-assortment of the variation harboured within a strain readily fixed one such trait, making it robust and prion-independent. Finally, we genetically screened for unknown prion elements. Fully one-third of wild strains harboured them. These, too, created diverse, often beneficial phenotypes. Thus, prions broadly govern heritable traits in nature, in a manner that could profoundly expand adaptive opportunities.},

abstract = {The amazing climbing ability of geckos has attracted the interest of philosophers and scientists alike for centuries. However, only in the past few years has progress been made in understanding the mechanism behind this ability, which relies on submicrometre keratin hairs covering the soles of geckos. Each hair produces a miniscule force approximately 10(-7) N (due to van der Waals and/or capillary interactions) but millions of hairs acting together create a formidable adhesion of approximately 10 N x cm(-2): sufficient to keep geckos firmly on their feet, even when upside down on a glass ceiling. It is very tempting to create a new type of adhesive by mimicking the gecko mechanism. Here we report on a prototype of such 'gecko tape' made by microfabrication of dense arrays of flexible plastic pillars, the geometry of which is optimized to ensure their collective adhesion. Our approach shows a way to manufacture self-cleaning, re-attachable dry adhesives, although problems related to their durability and mass production are yet to be resolved.},

abstract = {Psychrophilic, yellow-pigmented, seawater-requiring bacteria isolated from the pycnocline of meromictic Burton Lake and from sea ice cores obtained in the Vestfold Hills (68 degrees S, 78 degrees E) in eastern Antarctica were characterized. Phenotypic analysis showed that the strains isolated formed two distinct taxa. The first taxon included nonmotile, nutritionally fastidious strains that were isolated from the pycnocline of Burton Lake. The cells of these strains were morphologically variant, ranging from vibrioid to ring shaped to coiled and filamentous; in addition, the strains were unable to metabolise carbohydrates or polysaccharides and had DNA G + C contents of 27 to 29 mol\%. The strains of the second taxon, which were isolated from sea ice cores and from ice aigal biomass, were saccharolytic, exhibited rapid gliding motility, were rodlike to filamentous, and had DNA G + C contents of 36 to 38 mol\%. A 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence analysis revealed that the two Antarctic taxa formed related but distinct lineages within the [Flexibacter] maritimus rRNA branch of the family Flavobacteriacrae. The levels of 16S rDNA sequence similarity between the taxa were 90.5 to 91.3\%, while the levels of similarity to other members of the [F.] maritimus rRNA branch were 85 to 90\%. The whole-cell lipid profiles of the Antarctic strains were mainly comprised of branched and unbranched monounsaturated C15 to C17 fatty acids. The presence of significant levels of the lipids a 15:1 omega 10c and a17:1 omega 7c appeared to be useful biomarkers for the new Antarctic taxa and for differentiating these organisms from other members of the family Flavobacteriaceae. On the basis of polyphasic taxonomic data we propose that the new taxa are novel bacterial species designated Psychroserpens burtonensis gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain, ACAM 188) and Gelidibacter algens gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain, ACAM 536).},

On the website http://www.arb-silva.de/projects/living-tree an update has been regularly maintained by including the 1301 new descriptions that have appeared in the validation and notification lists of the IJSEM journal. The topology of the 16S rRNA-based tree was validated with a detailed comparison against a collection of taxa-specific and broad-range trees made using different approaches, subsets of sequences and alignments. Seven percent of the classified species is still missing, as their type strains do not have a good quality SSU sequence. In addition, a new database of type strains for which adequate 23S rRNA entries existed in public repositories was built. Among the 8602 species with validly published names until February 2010, we were able to find good quality LSU representatives for 792 type strains, whereas around 91\% of the complete catalogue still remains unsequenced. Despite the scarce representation of some groups in LSU databases, we have devised a highly optimized alignment and a reliable LSU tree in order to set up a stable phylogenetic starting point for taxonomic purposes. The current release corresponds to the fourth update of the project (LTPs102), and contains additional features which increase usability and compatibility. Use the contact address living-tree@arb-silva.de to provide additional input for the development of this taxonomic tool.},

abstract = {Biomimetic nanopores based on membrane-spanning single-walled carbon nanotubes have been designed to include selectivity filters based on combinations of anionic and cationic groups mimicking those present in bacterial porins and in voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels. The ion permeation and selectivity properties of these nanopores when embedded in a phospholipid bilayer have been explored by molecular dynamics simulations and free energy profile calculations. The interactions of the nanopores with sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride ions have been explored as a function of the number of anionic and cationic groups within the selectivity filter. Unbiased molecular dynamics simulations show that the overall selectivity is largely determined by the net charge of the filter. Analysis of distribution functions reveals considerable structuring of the distribution of ions and water within the nanopores. The distributions of ions along the pore axis reveal local selectivity for cations around filter, even in those nanopores (C0) where the net filter charge is zero. Single ion free energy profiles also reveal clear evidence for cation selectivity, even in the C0 nanopores. Detailed analysis of the interactions of the C0 nanopore with Ca(2+) ions reveals that local interactions with the anionic (carboxylate) groups of the selectivity filter lead to (partial) replacement of solvating water as the ion passes through the pore. These studies suggest that a computational biomimetic approach can be used to evaluate our understanding of the design principles of nanopores and channels.},

abstract = {Previous studies have reported a positive correlation between the GC content of the double-stranded regions of structural RNAs and the optimal growth temperature (OGT) in prokaryotes. These observations led to the hypothesis that natural selection favors an increase in GC content to ensure the correct folding and the structural stability of the molecule at high temperature. To date these studies have focused mainly on ribosomal and transfer RNAs. Therefore, we addressed the question of the relationship between GC content and OGT in a different and universally conserved structural RNA, the RNA component of the signal recognition particle (SRP). To this end we generated the secondary structures of SRP-RNAs for mesophilic, thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic bacterial and archaeal species. The analysis of the GC content in the stems and loops of the SRP-RNA of these organisms failed to detect a relationship between the GC contents in the stems of this structural RNA and the growth temperature of bacteria. By contrast, we found that in archaea the GC content in the stem regions of SRP-RNA is highest in hyperthermophiles, intermediate in thermophiles, and lower in mesophiles. In these organisms, we demonstrated a clear positive correlation between the GC content of the stem regions of their SRP-RNAs and their OGT. This correlation was confirmed by a phylogenetic nonindependence analysis. Thus we conclude that in archaea the increase in GC content in the stem regions of SRP-RNA is an adaptation response to environmental temperature.},

abstract = {A comparison is made between orthologous proteins from a nonbarophile (Pyrococcus furiosus) and a barophile (Pyrococcus abyssi) organism. The pattern of asymmetries in the amino acid substitution process identifies the amino acids arginine, serine, glycine, valine and aspartic acid as those having the most barophilic behaviour, and tyrosine and glutamine as the least barophilic. The construction of a hydrostatic pressure asymmetry index (PAI) which orders the amino acids from the most barophilic to the least barophilic makes it possible to visualise the amino acid properties that best explain barophily. The polarity of amino acids is positively correlated to the PAI values, i.e., on average, the more polar amino acids possess a higher PAI value, that is to say they are more barophilic. Moreover, the "size" of amino acids (molecular weight) is negatively correlated to the PAI value, that is to say that, on average, high PAI values are associated to "small" amino acids which are therefore more barophilic than "larger" ones. These two amino acid properties are the same ones that are known for having been important in affecting the origin of genetic code organisation. All the above, as well as the significant and positive correlation between the number of codons attributed to the amino acids in the genetic code and the PAI values, seem to favour the hypothesis that genetic code structuring took place under high hydrostatic pressure.},

The cells of strain BM2(T) were motile, aerobic, rod-shaped and Gram-positive. The peptidoglycan was of the A1gamma type, and the diamino acid was meso-diaminopimelic acid. Growth was observed at NaCl concentrations between 5.0 and 25.0 \% (w/v) (the optimum being 10.0-15.0 \%, w/v), at pH 7.0-10.0 (optimum, pH 9.0-9.5) and at 20-50 degrees C. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was MK-7. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0) and anteiso-C(17 : 0). The G+C content of total DNA of strain BM2(T) was 37.0 mol\%. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain BM2(T) was most closely related to Alkalibacillus haloalkaliphilus DSM 5271(T) (98.0 \% sequence similarity). DNA-DNA hybridization results indicated low levels of relatedness between strain BM2(T) and A. haloalkaliphilus JCM 12303(T) (23 and 16 \% reciprocally), Alkalibacillus filiformis JCM 13893(T) (25 and 21 \%) and Alkalibacillus salilacus JCM 13894(T) (27 and 19 \%). On the basis of the phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics, strain BM2(T) represents a novel species, for which the name Alkalibacillus silvisoli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is BM2(T) (=JCM 14193(T)=DSM 18495(T)).},

abstract = {Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) is a powerful approach for characterizing RNA structure and dynamics at single-nucleotide resolution. However, SHAPE technology is limited, sometimes severely, because primer extension detection obscures structural information for approximately 15 nts at the 5' end and 40-60 nts at the 3' end of the RNA. Moreover, detection by primer extension is more complex than the actual structure-selective chemical interrogation step. Here we quantify covalent adducts in RNA directly by adduct-inhibited exoribonuclease degradation. RNA 2'-O-adducts block processivity of a 3'-->5' exoribonuclease, RNase R, to produce fragments that terminate three nucleotides 3' of the modification site. We analyzed the structure of the native thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) riboswitch aptamer domain and identified large changes in local nucleotide dynamics and global RNA structure upon ligand binding. In addition to numerous changes that can be attributed to ligand recognition, we identify a single nucleotide bulge register shift, distant from the binding site, that stabilizes the ligand-bound structure. Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by protection from exoribonuclease (RNase-detected SHAPE) should prove broadly useful for facile structural analysis of small noncoding RNAs and for RNAs that have functionally critical structures at their 5' and 3' ends.},

abstract = {Five Gram-negative, white-pigmented, spherical, chemoheterotrophic bacteria were isolated from seawater from Japan and the Republic of Palau by use of an in situ cultivation technique. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the five novel isolates, 02PA-Ca-133(T), YM14-201(T), H-MN57(T), H-MN48 and MN1-156, were closely affiliated to members of subdivision 4 within the phylum 'Verrucomicrobia'. The novel isolates shared 96-100 \% sequence similarity with each other and showed less than 90 \% similarity with the cultivated strains of subdivision 4. DNA-DNA relatedness values between strains 02PA-Ca-133(T), YM14-201(T) and H-MN57(T) were less than 70 \%; the value commonly accepted as the threshold for the phylogenetic definition of a species. Antibiotic susceptibility tests and amino acid analysis of cell-wall hydrolysates indicated that the novel isolates did not contain muramic acid or diaminopimelic acid in their cell walls, suggesting that these strains lack peptidoglycan. The DNA G+C contents of the five strains were 51-57 mol\%. The major menaquinone was MK-7 and C(16 : 0), C(16 : 1)omega 7c and anteiso-C(15 : 0) were the major fatty acids. On the basis of polyphasic taxonomic evidence, it is concluded that these strains should be classified as representing a new genus and three novel species in subdivision 4 of the phylum 'Verrucomicrobia', for which the names Pelagicoccus mobilis gen. nov., sp. nov.

Building on the Rosetta framework, we present a general method to simultaneously model the folding and docking of multiple-chain interleaved homo-oligomers. For more than a third of the cases in a benchmark set of interleaved homo-oligomers, the method generates near-native models of large alpha-helical bundles, interlocking beta sandwiches, and interleaved alpha/beta motifs with an accuracy high enough for molecular replacement based phasing. With the incorporation of NMR chemical shift information, accurate models can be obtained consistently for symmetric complexes with as many as 192 total amino acids; a blind prediction was within 1 A rmsd of the traditionally determined NMR structure, and fit independently collected RDC data equally well. Together, these results show that the Rosetta "fold-and-dock" protocol can produce models of homo-oligomeric complexes with near-atomic-level accuracy and should be useful for crystallographic phasing and the rapid determination of the structures of multimers with limited NMR information.},

abstract = {The hammerhead ribozyme, a small catalytic RNA molecule, cleaves, in the presence of magnesium ions, a specific phosphodiester bond within its own backbone, leading to 23-cyclic phosphate and 5-OH extremities. In order to study the dynamical flexibility of the hammerhead RNA, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the solvated crystal structure of an active hammerhead ribozyme, obtained after flash-freezing crystals soaked with magnesium. Because of a careful equilibration protocol and the use of the Ewald summation in calculating the electrostatic interactions, the RNA structure remained close to the crystal structure, as attested by a root-mean-square deviation below 2.5 A after 750 ps of simulation. All Watson-Crick base pairs were intact at the end of the simulations. The tertiary interactions, such as the sheared G.A pairs and the U-turn, important for the stabilisation of the three-dimensional RNA fold, were also retained. The results demonstrate that molecular dynamics simulations can be successfully used to investigate the dynamical behaviour of a ribozyme, thus, opening a road to study the role of transient structural changes involved in ribozyme catalysis.},

abstract = {Chloroplast RNA metabolism is controlled and excecuted by hundreds of nuclear-encoded, chloroplast-localized RNA binding proteins. Contrary to the nucleo-cytosolic compartment or bacteria, there is little evidence for non-coding RNAs that play a role as riboregulators of chloroplasts. We mined deep-sequencing datasets to identify short (16-28 nt) RNAs in the chloroplast genome and found 50 abundant small RNAs (sRNAs) represented by multiple, in some cases, thousands of sequencing reads, whereas reads are in general absent from the surrounding sequence space. Other than sRNAs representing the most highly abundant mRNAs, tRNAs and rRNAs, most sRNAs are located in non-coding regions and many are found a short distance upstream of start codons. By transcript end mapping we show that the 5' and 3' termini of chloroplast RNAs coincide with the ends of sRNAs. Sequences of sRNAs identified in Arabidopsis are conserved between different angiosperm species and in several cases, we identified putative orthologs in rice deep sequencing datasets. Recently, it was suggested that small chloroplast RNA fragments could result from the protective action of pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins against exonucleases, i.e. footprints of RNA binding proteins. Our data support this scenario on a transcriptome-wide level and suggest that a large number of sRNAs are in fact remnants of PPR protein targets.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli promoters show a large degree of sequence variation. However, they are all recognized specifically by RNA polymerase as the sites for transcription initiation, suggesting that they share common basic structural features distinguishing them from the rest of the sequence. Our hypothesis is that the promoter is determined not only by the two consensus sequences at -10 and -35, but also by the surrounding nucleotides, and that it is not only the identity of the nucleotides that is important for promoter function but the presence of specific physical-chemical and structural characteristics that are sequence dependent. This approach is supported by accumulating evidence indicating the role that the DNA conformation may play in modulating protein-DNA interaction. In this study, four intrinsic sequence-dependent characteristics are examined in E. coli promoter regions: helix stability, helix flexibility, and two conformational parameters represented by the DNA tendencies for B-->Z and B-->A transition. The promoter is defined by the consensus sequences and their vicinity and the examined properties are compared between promoter and random sequences. It is demonstrated that both the consensus and flanking regions are less stable, more flexible and show a higher tendency for the B conformation in comparison to random sequences. Discriminant analysis is used to evaluate the relative contributions of the various characteristics.},

@article{Will2013,
abstract = {Recent genome-wide computational screens that search for conservation of RNA secondary structure in whole-genome alignments (WGAs) have predicted thousands of structural noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). The sensitivity of such approaches, however, is limited, due to their reliance on sequence-based whole-genome aligners, which regularly misalign structural ncRNAs. This suggests that many more structural ncRNAs may remain undetected. Structure-based alignment, which could increase the sensitivity, has been prohibitive for genome-wide screens due to its extreme computational costs. Breaking this barrier, we present the pipeline REAPR (RE-Alignment for Prediction of structural ncRNA), which efficiently realigns whole genomes based on RNA sequence and structure, thus allowing us to boost the performance of de novo ncRNA predictors, such as RNAz. Key to the pipeline's efficiency is the development of a novel banding technique for multiple RNA alignment. REAPR significantly outperforms the widely used predictors RNAz and EvoFold in genome-wide screens; in direct comparison to the most recent RNAz screen on D. melanogaster, REAPR predicts twice as many high-confidence ncRNA candidates. Moreover, modENCODE RNA-seq experiments confirm a substantial number of its predictions as transcripts. REAPR's advancement of de novo structural characterization of ncRNAs complements the identification of transcripts from rapidly accumulating RNA-seq data.},

abstract = {Biotic communities and ecosystem dynamics in terrestrial Antarctica are limited by an array of extreme conditions including low temperatures, moisture and organic matter availability, high salinity, and a paucity of biodiversity to facilitate key ecological processes. Recent studies have discovered that the prokaryotic communities in these extreme systems are highly diverse with patchy distributions. Investigating the physical and biological controls over the distribution and activity of microbial biodiversity in Victoria Land is essential to understanding ecological functioning in this region. Currently, little information on the distribution, structure and activity of soil communities anywhere in Victoria Land are available, and their sensitivity to potential climate change remains largely unknown. We investigated soil microbial communities from low- and high-productivity habitats in an isolated Antarctic location to determine how the soil environment impacts microbial community composition and structure. The microbial communities in Luther Vale, Northern Victoria Land were analysed using bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and were related to soil geochemical parameters and classical morphological analysis of soil metazoan invertebrate communities. A total of 323 16S rRNA gene sequences analysed from four soils spanning a productivity gradient indicated a high diversity (Shannon-Weaver values > 3) of phylotypes within the clone libraries and distinct differences in community structure between the two soil productivity habitats linked to water and nutrient availability. In particular, members of the Deinococcus/Thermus lineage were found exclusively in the drier, low-productivity soils, while Gammaproteobacteria of the genus Xanthomonas were found exclusively in high-productivity soils. However, rarefaction curves indicated that these microbial habitats remain under-sampled. Our results add to the recent literature suggesting that there is a higher biodiversity within Antarctic soils than previously expected.},

abstract = {RNase E plays an essential role in RNA processing and decay and tethers to the cytoplasmic membrane in Escherichia coli; however, the function of this membrane-protein interaction has remained unclear. Here, we establish a mechanistic role for the RNase E-membrane interaction. The reconstituted highly conserved N-terminal fragment of RNase E (NRne, residues 1-499) binds specifically to anionic phospholipids through electrostatic interactions. The membrane-binding specificity of NRne was confirmed using circular dichroism difference spectroscopy; the dissociation constant (K(d)) for NRne binding to anionic liposomes was 298 nM. E. coli RNase G and RNase E/G homologs from phylogenetically distant Aquifex aeolicus, Haemophilus influenzae Rd, and Synechocystis sp. were found to be membrane-binding proteins. Electrostatic potentials of NRne and its homologs were found to be conserved, highly positive, and spread over a large surface area encompassing four putative membrane-binding regions identified in the "large" domain (amino acids 1-400, consisting of the RNase H, S1, 5'-sensor, and DNase I subdomains) of E. coli NRne. In vitro cleavage assay using liposome-free and liposome-bound NRne and RNA substrates BR13 and GGG-RNAI showed that NRne membrane binding altered its enzymatic activity. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed no obvious thermotropic structural changes in membrane-bound NRne between 10 and 60 °C, and membrane-bound NRne retained its normal cleavage activity after cooling. Thus, NRne membrane binding induced changes in secondary protein structure and enzymatic activation by stabilizing the protein-folding state and increasing its binding affinity for its substrate. Our results demonstrate that RNase E-membrane interaction enhances the rate of RNA processing and decay.},

Here, we demonstrate that decapping also modulates expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Specifically, levels of >100 lncRNAs in yeast are controlled by decapping and are degraded by a pathway that occurs independent of decapping regulators. We find many lncRNAs degraded by DCP2 are expressed proximal to inducible genes. Of these, we show several genes required for galactose utilization are associated with lncRNAs that have expression patterns inversely correlated with their mRNA counterpart. Moreover, decapping of these lncRNAs is critical for rapid and robust induction of GAL gene expression. Failure to destabilize a lncRNA known to exert repressive histone modifications results in perpetuation of a repressive chromatin state that contributes to reduced plasticity of gene activation. We propose that decapping and lncRNA degradation serve a vital role in transcriptional regulation specifically at inducible genes.},

In this article, an expanded set of misacylated tRNAs and two 2'-deoxynucleotide-substituted mRNAs are used to demonstrate the presence of a lower threshold in k(off) values for aa-tRNA binding to the A site. When a tRNA binds sufficiently well to reach this threshold, additional stabilizing effects due to the esterified amino acid or changes in tRNA sequence are not observed. However, specificity for different amino acid side chains and the tRNA body is observed when tRNA binding is sufficiently weaker than this threshold. We propose that uniform aa-tRNA binding to the A site may be a consequence of a conformational change in the ribosome, induced by the presence of the appropriate combination of contributions from the anticodon, amino acid and tRNA body.},

The deposition of the salt is thought to have occurred during the Permian period (225-280 million years ago). The 16S rDNA sequences of the strains were 97.1\% similar to that of the type species of the genus Halobacterium, which was also determined in this work. Polar lipids consisted of C20-C20 derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol, methylated phosphatidylglycerol phosphate, phosphatidylglycerol sulfate, triglycosyl diether and sulfated tetraglycosyl diether. Optimal salinity for growth was 15-17.5\% NaCl; Mg++ was tolerated up to a concentration of 1 M. The DNA-DNA reassociation value of strain A1T was 25\% with H. salinarum DSM 3754T and 41\% with Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, respectively. Based on these results and other properties, e.g. whole cell protein patterns, menaquinone content and restriction patterns of DNA, strains A1 and A2 are members of a single species, for which we propose the name H. noricense. The type strain is A1 (DSM 15987T, ATCC BAA-852T, NCIMB 13967T). Since we present evidence that Halobacterium sp.

The bacterium was aerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-motile, exhibited a rod-coccus growth cycle and produced a yellow pigment that was insoluble in water but soluble in methanol. No growth factors were required and it was able to grow between 5 and 30 degrees C, between pH 6 and pH 9 and tolerated up to 11.5\% NaCl. The cell wall peptidoglycan was Lys-Thr-Ala3 (the A3alpha variant) and the major menaquinone was MK-9(H2). The G+C content of the DNA was 64+/-2 mol\%. The 16S rDNA analysis indicated that CMS 19YT is closely related to group I Arthrobacter species and showed highest sequence similarity (97.91\%) with Arthrobacter agilis. Furthermore, DNA-DNA. hybridization studies also indicated 77\% homology between CMS 19YT and A. agilis. It differed from A. agilis, however, in that it was psychrophilic, non-motile, yellow in colour, exhibited a rod-coccus growth cycle, had a higher degree of tolerance to NaCl and was oxidase- and urease-negative and lipase-positive.

abstract = {A Gram-positive, psychrophilic, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain N-05(T), was isolated from soil samples collected off King George Island, west Antarctica (6 degrees 13' 31'' S 5 degrees 57' 08'' W). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain N-05(T) was related to members of the genus Sporosarcina and had highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with the type strain of Sporosarcina macmurdoensis (98.0\%). The temperature range for growth of strain N-05(T) was 0-23 degrees C, with optimum growth occurring at 17-18 degrees C and approximately pH 6.0-8.0. Strain N-05(T) had MK-7 as the major menaquinone and anteiso-C(15:0) and C(16:1)omega7c alcohol as major fatty acids. The genomic DNA G+C content was 39.2 mol\%. On the basis of phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic analysis and DNA-DNA relatedness data, strain N-05(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Sporosarcina, for which the name Sporosarcina antarctica is proposed. The type strain is N-05(T) (=CGMCC 1.6503(T)=JCM 14646(T)).},

abstract = {Determining the conformational rearrangements of large macromolecules is challenging experimentally and computationally. Case in point is the ribosome; it has been observed by high-resolution crystallography in several states, but many others are known only from low-resolution methods including cryo-electron microscopy. Combining these data into dynamical trajectories that may aid understanding of its largest-scale conformational changes has so far remained out of reach of computational methods. Most existing methods either model all atoms explicitly, resulting in often prohibitive cost, or use approximations that lose interesting structural and dynamical detail. In this work, I introduce Internal Coordinate Flexible Fitting, which uses full atomic forces and flexibility in limited regions of a model, capturing extensive conformational rearrangements at low cost. I use it to turn multiple low-resolution density maps, crystallographic structures and biochemical information into unified all-atoms trajectories of ribosomal translocation. Internal Coordinate Flexible Fitting is three orders of magnitude faster than the most comparable existing method.},

The cells are spherical shaped and 0.8 to 1.2 microns in diameter. Various proteinaceous complex compounds served as substrates during aerobic growth.

Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.},

This paper reviews the intrinsic network of modifications in the structural core of the tRNA, which governs structural flexibility and rigidity to fine-tune the molecule to peak performance and to regulate its steady-state level. Structural effects of RNA modifications range from nanometer-scale rearrangements to subtle restrictions of conformational space on the angstrom scale. Structural stabilization resulting from nucleotide modification results in increased thermal stability and translates into protection against unspecific degradation by bases and nucleases. Several mechanisms of specific degradation of hypomodified tRNA, which were only recently discovered, provide a link between structural and metabolic stability.},

In the present study, a novel obligately respiratory, denitrifying and RDX-mineralizing bacterium, designated strain HAW-EB4(T), was isolated from the marine sediment. This bacterium utilized peptone, yeast extract, Casamino acids, esters (Tweens 20, 40 and 80), sugars (N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, ribose), several C2 and C3 acids (acetate, pyruvate, lactate, propionate) and amino acids (serine, proline) as sole carbon and energy sources. Aerobically grown cells (in marine broth 2216 at 10 degrees C) contained C(14 : 0) (6 \%), iso-C(15 : 0) (12 \%), C(16 : 0) (20 \%), C(16 : 1)omega7 (37 \%), C(18 : 1)omega7 (7 \%) and C(20 : 5)omega3 (7 \%) as major membrane fatty acids, and Q7 (28.1 \%) and MK-7 (60.9 \%) as dominant respiratory quinones, consistent with deep-sea species of Shewanella. The novel bacterium had a DNA G+C content of 45 mol\% and showed similarity to Shewanella species in terms of 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequences (93-99 and 67.3-88.4 \% similarity, respectively), with Shewanella pealeana being the most closely related species. Genomic DNA-DNA hybridization between strain HAW-EB4T and S. pealeana revealed a level of relatedness of 17.9 \%, lower than the 70 \% species cut-off value, indicating that strain HAW-EB4T (= NCIMB 14093T = DSM 17350T) is the type strain of a novel species of Shewanella, for which the name Shewanella halifaxensis sp. nov. is proposed.},

A wide variety of phylogenetic and dating methods have been developed that aim either to test for the existence of rate variation or to correct for its bias. However, none of the existing methods track the evolution of features that account for observed rate heterogeneity. Here, we present a likelihood model that assumes that rate variation is caused, in part, by species' intrinsic characteristics, such as a particular life-history trait, morphological feature, or habitat association. The model combines models of sequence and character state evolution such that rates of sequence change depend on the character state of a lineage at each point in time. We test, using simulations, the power and accuracy of the model to determine whether rates of molecular evolution depend on a particular character state and demonstrate its utility using an empirical example with halophilic and freshwater daphniids.},

abstract = {Transcription elongation factors from the NusG family are ubiquitous from bacteria to humans and play diverse roles in the regulation of gene expression. These proteins consist of at least two domains. The N-terminal domains directly bind to the largest, $\beta$' in bacteria, subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP), whereas the C-terminal domains interact with other cellular components and serve as platforms for the assembly of large nucleoprotein complexes. Escherichia coli NusG and its paralog RfaH modify RNAP into a fast, pause-resistant state but the detailed molecular mechanism of this modification remains unclear since no high-resolution structural data are available for the E. coli system. We wanted to investigate whether Thermus thermophilus (Tth) NusG can be used as a model for structural studies of this family of regulators. Here, we show that Tth NusG slows down rather than facilitates transcript elongation by its cognate RNAP. On the other hand, similarly to the E. coli regulators, Tth NusG apparently binds near the upstream end of the transcription bubble, competes with $\sigma$(A), and favors forward translocation by RNAP. Our data suggest that the mechanism of NusG recruitment to RNAP is universally conserved even though the regulatory outcomes among its homologs may appear distinct.},

abstract = {Many hairpin and internal RNA 3D motif structures are recurrent, occurring in various types of RNA molecules, not necessarily homologs. Although usually drawn as single-strand “loops” in RNA 2D diagrams, recurrent motifs share a common 3D structure, but can vary in sequence. It is essential to understand the sequence variability of RNA 3D motifs in order to advance the RNA 2D and 3D structure prediction and ncRNA discovery methods, to interpret mutations that affect ncRNAs, and to guide experimental functional studies. The dissertation is organized into two parts as follows. First, the development of a new online resource called RNA 3D Hub is described, which is intended to provide a useful resource for structure modeling and prediction. It houses non-redundant sets of RNA-containing 3D structures, RNA 3D motifs extracted from all RNA 3D structures, and the RNA 3D Motif Atlas, a representative collection of RNA 3D motifs. Unique and stable ids are assigned to all non- redundant equivalence classes of structure files, to all motifs, and to all motif instances. RNA 3D Hub is updated automatically on a regular schedule and is available at http://rna.bgsu.edu/rna3dhub. In the second part of the dissertation, the development of WebFR3D (http://rna.bgsu.edu/webfr3d), a new webserver for finding and aligning RNA 3D motifs, is described and its use in a biologically relevant context is then illustrated using two RNA 3D motifs. The first motif was predicted in Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid (PSTVd), and the prediction ii was supported by functional evidence. The second motif had previously been undescribed, although it is found in multiple 3D structures. RNA 3D Hub, RNA 3D Motif Atlas, and the bioinformatic techniques discussed in this dissertation lay the groundwork for further research into RNA 3D motif prediction starting from sequence and provide useful online resources for the scientific community worldwide.},

Enterococcus faecalis is readily identified by biochemical tests, but species differentiation within the Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus gallinarum species groups is less well established. In the present study, 66 strains representing the most prevalent human enterococci were used to develop a PCR-based species-specific identification protocol. Whole-cell protein analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used as a reference method for species identification. In addition, the genomic SmaI macro-restriction fragment distribution of all of the strains was examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Oligonucleotide D11344-primed PCR was as discriminative as whole-cell protein analysis and resulted in more easily interpreted band patterns. This PCR-based technique allowed identification of clinical isolates by visual examination of the DNA profiles obtained. The inability of both methods to discriminate between Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus flavescens brought into question the species status of E. flavescens. PFGE did not result in species-discriminative DNA bands or band patterns, but proved to be superior for interpretation of interstrain relationships.},

abstract = {Vibrio costicola grown in the presence of different NaCl concentrations contains cell-associated Na+ and K+ ions whose sum is equal to or greater than the external Na+ concentration. In the presence of 0.5 M NaCl, virtually no in vitro protein is synthesized in extracts of cells grown in 1.0 M NaCl. However, we report here that active in vitro protein synthesis occurred in 0.6 M or higher concentrations of Na2SO4, sodium formate, sodium acetate, sodium aspartate, or sodium glutamate, whereas 0.6 M NaF, NaCl, or NaBr completely inhibited protein synthesis as measured by polyuridylic acid-directed incorporation of [14C]phenylalanine. Sodium glutamate, sodium aspartate, and betaine (0.3 M) counteracted the inhibitory action of 0.6 M NaCl. The cell-associated Cl- concentration was 0.22 mol/kg in cells grown in 1.0 M NaCl. Of this, the free intracellular Cl- concentration was only 0.02 mol/kg. Cells contained 0.11 mol of glutamate per kg and small concentrations of other amino acids. All of the negative counterions for cell-associated Na+ and K+ have not yet been determined. In vitro protein synthesis by Escherichia coli was inhibited by sodium glutamate. Hybridization experiments with ribosomes and the soluble (S-100) fractions from extracts of E. coli and V. costicola showed that the glutamate-sensitive fraction was found in the soluble, not the ribosomal, part of the system. The phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase of V. costicola was not inhibited by 0.5 M or higher concentrations of NaCl; it was slightly more sensitive to high concentrations of sodium glutamate. Therefore, this enzyme was not responsible for the salt response of the V. costicola in vitro protein-synthesizing system.},

abstract = {The Escherichia coli rluD gene encodes a pseudouridine synthase responsible for the pseudouridine ($\Psi$) modifications at positions 1911, 1915, and 1917 in helix 69 of 23S rRNA. It has been reported that deletion of rluD in K-12 strains of E. coli is associated with extremely slow growth, increased readthrough of stop codons, and defects in 50S ribosomal subunit assembly and 30S-50S subunit association. Suppressor mutations in the prfB and prfC genes encoding release factor 2 (RF2) and RF3 that restore the wild type-growth rate and also correct the ribosomal defects have now been isolated. These suppressors link helix 69 $\Psi$ residues with the termination phase of protein synthesis. However, further genetic analysis reported here also reveals that the slow growth and other defects associated with inactivation of rluD in E. coli K-12 strains are due to a defective RF2 protein, with a threonine at position 246, which is present in all K-12 strains. This is in contrast to the more typical alanine found at this position in most bacterial RF2s, including those of other E. coli strains. Inactivation of rluD in E. coli strains containing the prfB allele from E. coli B or in Salmonella enterica, both carrying an RF2 with Ala246, has negligible effects on growth, termination, or ribosome function. The results indicate that, in contrast to those in wild bacteria, termination functions in E. coli K-12 strains carrying a partially defective RF2 protein are especially susceptible to perturbation of ribosome-RF interactions, such as that caused by loss of h69 $\Psi$ modifications.},

abstract = {A rod-shaped Gram-staining-negative, non-motile, aerobic and fucoidan-digesting strain, designated TC2(T), was isolated from marine algae collected from the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk at Abashiri, Hokkaido, Japan. The bacterium formed yellow, translucent, circular and convex colonies. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the strain belonged to the genus Flavobacterium, with the highest sequence similarities of 97.1 to 97.3 \% to the type strains of Flavobacterium frigidarium, Flavobacterium frigoris, Flavobacterium limicola and Flavobacterium psychrolimnae. DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain TC2(T) and the above-mentioned species were lower than 28 \%. The genomic DNA G+C content was 33.9 mol\%. The major respiratory quinone was menaquinone-6 and the predominant fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 1) G, iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(15 : 0) 3-OH and summed feature 3 (which comprises iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH and/or C(16 : 1)omega7c). Strain TC2(T) could be differentiated from related species by several phenotypic characteristics. Thus, on the basis of these results, strain TC2(T) represents a novel species of the genus Flavobacterium, for which the name Flavobacterium algicola sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TC2(T) (=NBRC 102673(T) =CIP 109574(T)).},

abstract = {Determining the structural properties of mRNA is key to understanding vital post-transcriptional processes. As experimental data on mRNA structure are scarce, accurate structure prediction is required to characterize RNA regulatory mechanisms. Although various structure prediction approaches are available, it is often unclear which to choose and how to set their parameters. Furthermore, no standard measure to compare predictions of local structure exists. We assessed the performance of different methods using two types of data: transcriptome-wide enzymatic probing information and a large, curated set of cis-regulatory elements. To compare the approaches, we introduced structure accuracy, a measure that is applicable to both global and local methods. Our results showed that local folding was more accurate than the classic global approach. We investigated how the locality parameters, maximum base pair span and window size, influenced the prediction performance. A span of 150 provided a reasonable balance between maximizing the number of accurately predicted base pairs, while minimizing effects of incorrect long-range predictions. We characterized the error at artificial sequence ends, which we reduced by setting the window size sufficiently greater than the maximum span. Our method, LocalFold, diminished all border effects and produced the most robust performance.},

With the abundance of sequence data, an integrative approach of adding new sequences to existing alignments without their full re-computation and maintaining the relative matching of existing sequences is an attractive option. Another current challenge is the extension of reference alignments with fragmented sequences, as those coming from next-generation metagenomics, that contain relatively little information. Widely used methods for alignment extension are based on profile representation of reference sequences. These do not incorporate and use phylogenetic information and are affected by the composition of the reference alignment and the phylogenetic positions of query sequences.},

abstract = {The structure and biological function of the DNA double helix are based on interactions recognizing sequence complementarity between two single strands of DNA. A single DNA strand can also recognize the double helix sequence by binding in its groove and forming a triplex. We now find that sequence recognition occurs between intact DNA duplexes without any single-stranded elements as well. We have imaged a mixture of two fluorescently tagged, double helical DNA molecules that have identical nucleotide composition and length (50\% GC; 294 base pairs) but different sequences. In electrolytic solution at minor osmotic stress, these DNAs form discrete liquid-crystalline aggregates (spherulites). We have observed spontaneous segregation of the two kinds of DNA within each spherulite, which reveals that nucleotide sequence recognition occurs between double helices separated by water in the absence of proteins, consistent with our earlier theoretical hypothesis. We thus report experimental evidence and discuss possible mechanisms for the recognition of homologous DNAs from a distance.},

abstract = {Non-Watson-Crick base pairs mediate specific interactions responsible for RNA-RNA self-assembly and RNA-protein recognition. An unambiguous and descriptive nomenclature with well-defined and nonoverlapping parameters is needed to communicate concisely structural information about RNA base pairs. The definitions should reflect underlying molecular structures and interactions and, thus, facilitate automated annotation, classification, and comparison of new RNA structures. We propose a classification based on the observation that the planar edge-to-edge, hydrogen-bonding interactions between RNA bases involve one of three distinct edges: the Watson-Crick edge, the Hoogsteen edge, and the Sugar edge (which includes the 2'-OH and which has also been referred to as the Shallow-groove edge). Bases can interact in either of two orientations with respect to the glycosidic bonds, cis or trans relative to the hydrogen bonds. This gives rise to 12 basic geometric types with at least two H bonds connecting the bases. For each geometric type, the relative orientations of the strands can be easily deduced. High-resolution examples of 11 of the 12 geometries are presently available. Bifurcated pairs, in which a single exocyclic carbonyl or amino group of one base directly contacts the edge of a second base, and water-inserted pairs, in which single functional groups on each base interact directly, are intermediate between two of the standard geometries. The nomenclature facilitates the recognition of isosteric relationships among base pairs within each geometry, and thus facilitates the recognition of recurrent three-dimensional motifs from comparison of homologous sequences. Graphical conventions are proposed for displaying non-Watson-Crick interactions on a secondary structure diagram. The utility of the classification in homology modeling of RNA tertiary motifs is illustrated.},

abstract = {We developed a coarse grained two-well model to study the single molecule protein conformational dynamics in microscopic detail at the residue level, overcoming the often encountered computational bottleneck. In particular, we explored the underlying conformational energy landscape of adenylate kinase, a crucial protein for signal transduction in the cell, and identified two major kinetic pathways for the conformational switch between open and closed states through either the intermediate state or the transient state. Based on the parameters fitted to the room-temperature experimental data, we predicted open and closed kinetic rates at the whole temperature ranges from 10 to 50 degrees C, which agree well with the experimental turnover numbers. After uncovering the underlying mechanism for conformational dynamics and exploring the structural correlations, we found the crucial dynamical interplay between the nucleoside monophosphate binding domain (NMP) and the ATP-binding domain (LID) in controlling the conformational switch. The key residues and contacts responsible for the conformational transitions are identified by following the time evolution of the two-dimensional spatial contact maps and characterizing the transition state as well as intermediate structure ensembles through phi value analysis. Our model provides a general framework to study the conformational dynamics of biomolecules and can be applied to many other systems.},

On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, in combination with chemotaxonomic data, strains CCUG 47242T and HKU3 represent two novel species of a new genus of endospore-forming bacteria for which we propose the names Cohnella thermotolerans gen. nov., sp. nov.

abstract = {The physiology of the deep-sea hyperthermophilic, anaerobic vent archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi, originating from the Fiji Basin at a depth of 2,000 m, was studied under diverse conditions. The emphasis of these studies lay in the growth and survival of this archaeon under the different conditions present in the natural habitat. Incubation under in situ pressure (20 MPa) and at 40 MPa increased the maximal and minimal growth temperatures by 4(deg)C. In situ pressure enhanced survival at a lethal high temperature (106 to 112(deg)C) relative to that at low pressure (0.3 MPa). The whole-cell protein profile, analyzed by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, did not change in cultures grown under low or high pressure at optimal and minimal growth temperatures, but several changes were observed at the maximal growth temperature under in situ pressure. The complex lipid pattern of P. abyssi grown under in situ and 0.1- to 0.5-MPa pressures at different temperatures was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. The phospholipids became more complex at a low growth temperature at both pressures but their profiles were not superimposable; fewer differences were observed in the core lipids. The polar lipids were composed of only one phospholipid in cells grown under in situ pressure at high temperatures. Survival in the presence of oxygen and under starvation conditions was examined. Oxygen was toxic to P. abyssi at growth range temperature, but the strain survived for several weeks at 4(deg)C. The strain was not affected by starvation in a minimal medium for at least 1 month at 4(deg)C and only minimally affected at 95(deg)C for several days. Cells were more resistant to oxygen in starvation medium. A drastic change in protein profile, depending on incubation time, was observed in cells when starved at growth temperature.},

abstract = {Sequencing ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes is currently the method of choice for phylogenetic reconstruction, nucleic acid based detection and quantification of microbial diversity. The ARB software suite with its corresponding rRNA datasets has been accepted by researchers worldwide as a standard tool for large scale rRNA analysis. However, the rapid increase of publicly available rRNA sequence data has recently hampered the maintenance of comprehensive and curated rRNA knowledge databases. A new system, SILVA (from Latin silva, forest), was implemented to provide a central comprehensive web resource for up to date, quality controlled databases of aligned rRNA sequences from the Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya domains. All sequences are checked for anomalies, carry a rich set of sequence associated contextual information, have multiple taxonomic classifications, and the latest validly described nomenclature. Furthermore, two precompiled sequence datasets compatible with ARB are offered for download on the SILVA website: (i) the reference (Ref) datasets, comprising only high quality, nearly full length sequences suitable for in-depth phylogenetic analysis and probe design and (ii) the comprehensive Parc datasets with all publicly available rRNA sequences longer than 300 nucleotides suitable for biodiversity analyses. The latest publicly available database release 91 (August 2007) hosts 547 521 sequences split into 461 823 small subunit and 85 689 large subunit rRNAs.},

abstract = {Two Gram-stain-positive, pigmented, non-motile, non-spore-forming, pleomorphic, rod-shaped bacteria (strains SV45(T) and SV47), isolated from a permafrost soil collected from the Adventdalen valley, Spitsbergen, northern Norway, have been characterized taxonomically using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the two permafrost isolates formed a distinct phyletic line within the suborder Micrococcineae of the order Actinomycetales. DNA-DNA hybridization analyses indicate that strains SV45(T) and SV47 are closely related (60-69 \% relatedness) and belong to the same species, although they show slightly different colony pigmentation. The closest phylogenetic neighbour was Demequina aestuarii JC2054(T), with 96 \% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. Optimum growth of SV45(T) and SV47 occurred aerobically in the absence of NaCl, but both isolates tolerated up to 2 \% NaCl (w/v) in the growth medium. Growth under anaerobic conditions was slow and weak. The peptidoglycan of both isolates was of the A4beta type with l-ornithine as the diamino acid and serine as a component of the interpeptide bridge with either d-aspartate (SV45(T)) or d-glutamate (SV47) as the N-terminal amino acid. The major fatty acids present in both isolates were C(15 : 0) (3.2-8.6 \%), iso-C(16 : 0) (5.0-8.9 \%), anteiso-C(15 : 0) (59.4-61.5 \%), anteiso-C(17 : 0) (4.1-8.8 \%) and anteiso-C(15 : 1) (4.4-6.4 \%). Isoprenoid quinones were present at exceptionally low levels in both isolates, and only demethylmenaquinone DMK-9(H(4)) could be identified with any degree of confidence. Phylogenetic analysis and differences in physiological and biochemical characteristics between the strains and Demequina aestuarii JC2054(T) indicate that these isolates belong to a novel species within the genus Demequina, for which the name Demequina lutea sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SV45(T) (=LMG 24795(T) =DSM 19970(T)).},

These studies have uncovered previously unknown proteins and pathways crucial for normal cell function that the virus manipulates to achieve optimal virus replication and gene expression. In the infecting virion, the viral DNA is tightly condensed in a virally encoded protamine-like protein which must be remodeled within the first few hours of infection to allow for efficient expression of virus-encoded genes and subsequent viral DNA replication. This review discusses our current knowledge of Ad DNA-protein complex within the infected cell nucleus, the cellular proteins the virus utilizes to achieve chromatinization, and how this event contributes to efficient gene expression and progression of the virus life cycle.},

abstract = {The alpha subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) participates in promoter recognition through specific interactions with UP element DNA, a region upstream of the recognition hexamers for the sigma subunit (the -10 and -35 hexamers). UP elements have been described in only a small number of promoters, including the rRNA promoter rrnB P1, where the sequence has a very large (30- to 70-fold) effect on promoter activity. Here, we analyzed the effects of upstream sequences from several additional E. coli promoters (rrnD P1, rrnB P2, lambda pR, lac, merT, and RNA II). The relative effects of different upstream sequences were compared in the context of their own core promoters or as hybrids to the lac core promoter. Different upstream sequences had different effects, increasing transcription from 1.5- to approximately 90-fold, and several had the properties of UP elements: they increased transcription in vitro in the absence of accessory protein factors, and transcription stimulation required the C-terminal domain of the RNAP alpha subunit. The effects of the upstream sequences correlated generally with their degree of similarity to an UP element consensus sequence derived previously. Protection of upstream sequences by RNAP in footprinting experiments occurred in all cases and was thus not a reliable indicator of UP element strength. These data support a modular view of bacterial promoters in which activity reflects the composite effects of RNAP interactions with appropriately spaced recognition elements (-10, -35, and UP elements), each of which contributes to activity depending on its similarity to the consensus.},

abstract = {Here, we represent protein structures as residue interacting networks, which are assumed to involve a permanent flow of information between amino acids. By removal of nodes from the protein network, we identify fold centrally conserved residues, which are crucial for sustaining the shortest pathways and thus play key roles in long-range interactions. Analysis of seven protein families (myoglobins, G-protein-coupled receptors, the trypsin class of serine proteases, hemoglobins, oligosaccharide phosphorylases, nuclear receptor ligand-binding domains and retroviral proteases) confirms that experimentally many of these residues are important for allosteric communication. The agreement between the centrally conserved residues, which are key in preserving short path lengths, and residues experimentally suggested to mediate signaling further illustrates that topology plays an important role in network communication. Protein folds have evolved under constraints imposed by function. To maintain function, protein structures need to be robust to mutational events. On the other hand, robustness is accompanied by an extreme sensitivity at some crucial sites. Thus, here we propose that centrally conserved residues, whose removal increases the characteristic path length in protein networks, may relate to the system fragility.},

abstract = {Thermus thermophilus is a thermophilic model organism distantly related to the mesophilic model organism E. coli. We reconstituted protein translation of Thermus thermophilus in vitro from purified ribosomes, transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNAs) and 33 recombinant proteins. This reconstituted system was fully functional, capable of translating natural messenger RNA (mRNA) into active full-length proteins at temperatures up to 65°C and with yields up to 60 $\mu$g/ml. Surprisingly, the synthesis of active proteins also occurred at 37°C, a temperature well below the minimal growth temperature for T. thermophilus. A polyamine was required, with tetraamine being most effective, for translation at both high and low temperatures. Using such a defined in vitro system, we demonstrated a minimal set of components that are sufficient for synthesizing active proteins at high temperatures, the functional compatibility of key translation components between T. thermophilus and E. coli, and the functional conservation of a number of resurrected ancient elongation factors. This work sets the stage for future experiments that apply abundant structural information to biochemical characterization of protein translation and folding in T. thermophilus. Because it contains significantly reduced nucleases and proteases, this reconstituted thermostable cell-free protein synthesis system may enable in vitro engineering of proteins with improved thermostability.},

Here, we show that total microbial cell abundance in subseafloor sediment varies between sites by ca. five orders of magnitude. This variation is strongly correlated with mean sedimentation rate and distance from land. Based on these correlations, we estimate global subseafloor sedimentary microbial abundance to be 2.9⋅10(29) cells [corresponding to 4.1 petagram (Pg) C and ∼0.6\% of Earth's total living biomass]. This estimate of subseafloor sedimentary microbial abundance is roughly equal to previous estimates of total microbial abundance in seawater and total microbial abundance in soil. It is much lower than previous estimates of subseafloor sedimentary microbial abundance. In consequence, we estimate Earth's total number of microbes and total living biomass to be, respectively, 50-78\% and 10-45\% lower than previous estimates.},

The correlation of these ranks with the number of codons attributed to amino acids in the genetic code, together with another straightforward argument based on an optimisation percentage of a barophily index (BI) (easily defined by barophily ranks) which can be associated to the genetic code table, suggest that the genetic code originated under high hydrostatic pressure. Moreover, as the BI value can be calculated for the sequence of any protein, it also makes it possible to define the BI for the genetic code if the number of codons attributed to the amino acids in the code is assumed to be the frequency with which the amino acids appeared in ancestral proteins. Finally, sampling the BI variable between many non-barophile organisms and from many proteins of a single non-barophile organism leads to the conclusion that the BI value of the genetic code is not typical of these organisms. Whereas, since the genetic code BI value is statistically higher than that of these non-barophile organisms, it supports the hypothesis that genetic code structuring took place under high hydrostatic pressure.},

abstract = {Folding mechanisms in which secondary structures are stabilized through the formation of tertiary interactions are well documented in protein folding but challenge the folding hierarchy normally assumed for RNA. However, it is increasingly clear that RNA could fold by a similar mechanism. P5abc, a small independently folding tertiary domain of the Tetrahymena thermophila group I ribozyme, is known to fold by a secondary structure rearrangement involving helix P5c. However, the extent of this rearrangement and the precise stage of folding that triggers it are unknown. We use experiments and simulations to show that the P5c helix switches to the native secondary structure late in the folding pathway and is directly coupled to the formation of tertiary interactions in the A-rich bulge. P5c mutations show that the switch in P5c is not rate-determining and suggest that non-native interactions in P5c aid folding rather than impede it. Our study illustrates that despite significant differences in the building blocks of proteins and RNA, there may be common ways in which they self-assemble.},

abstract = {Functional analysis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) core particles has associated a number of biological roles with the C terminus of the capsid protein. One set of functions require the C terminus to be on the exterior of the capsid, while others place this domain on the interior. According to the crystal structure of the capsid, this segment is strictly internal to the capsid shell and buried at a protein-protein interface. Using kinetic hydrolysis, a form of protease digestion assayed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, the structurally and biologically important C-terminal region of HBV capsid protein assembly domain (Cp149, residues 1-149) has been shown to be dynamic in both dimer and capsid forms. HBV is an enveloped virus with a T=4 icosahedral core that is composed of 120 copies of a homodimer capsid protein. Free dimer and assembled capsid forms of the protein are readily hydrolyzed by trypsin and thermolysin, around residues 127-128, indicating that this region is dynamic and exposed to the capsid surface. The measured conformational equilibria have an opposite temperature dependence between free dimer and assembled capsid. This work helps to explain the previously described allosteric regulation of assembly and functional properties of a buried domain. These observations make a critical connection between structure, dynamics, and function: made possible by the first quantitative measurements of conformational equilibria and rates of conversion between protein conformers for a megaDalton complex.},

abstract = {The expression of photosynthesis genes in the facultatively photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides is controlled by the oxygen tension and by light quantity. Two photoreceptor proteins, AppA and CryB, have been identified in the past, which are involved in this regulation. AppA senses light by its N-terminal BLUF domain, its C-terminal part binds heme and is redox-responsive. Through its interaction to the transcriptional repressor PpsR the AppA photoreceptor controls expression of photosynthesis genes. The cryptochrome-like protein CryB was shown to affect regulation of photosynthesis genes, but the underlying signal chain remained unknown. Here we show that CryB interacts with the C-terminal domain of AppA and modulates the binding of AppA to the transcriptional repressor PpsR in a light-dependent manner. Consequently, binding of the transcription factor PpsR to its DNA target is affected by CryB. In agreement with this, all genes of the PpsR regulon showed altered expression levels in a CryB deletion strain after blue-light illumination. These results elucidate for the first time how a bacterial cryptochrome affects gene expression.},

abstract = {Ancient components of the ribosome, inferred from a consensus of previous work, were constructed in silico, in vitro and in vivo. The resulting model of the ancestral ribosome presented here incorporates ∼20\% of the extant 23S rRNA and fragments of five ribosomal proteins. We test hypotheses that ancestral rRNA can: (i) assume canonical 23S rRNA-like secondary structure, (ii) assume canonical tertiary structure and (iii) form native complexes with ribosomal protein fragments. Footprinting experiments support formation of predicted secondary and tertiary structure. Gel shift, spectroscopic and yeast three-hybrid assays show specific interactions between ancestral rRNA and ribosomal protein fragments, independent of other, more recent, components of the ribosome. This robustness suggests that the catalytic core of the ribosome is an ancient construct that has survived billions of years of evolution without major changes in structure. Collectively, the data here support a model in which ancestors of the large and small subunits originated and evolved independently of each other, with autonomous functionalities.},

abstract = {Due to advances in high-throughput biotechnologies biological information is being collected in databases at an amazing rate, requiring novel computational approaches that process collected data into new knowledge in a timely manner. In this study, we propose a computational framework for discovering modular structure, relationships and regularities in complex data. The framework utilizes a semantic-preserving vocabulary to convert records of biological annotations of an object, such as an organism, gene, chemical or sequence, into networks (Anets) of the associated annotations. An association between a pair of annotations in an Anet is determined by the similarity of their co-occurrence pattern with all other annotations in the data. This feature captures associations between annotations that do not necessarily co-occur with each other and facilitates discovery of the most significant relationships in the collected data through clustering and visualization of the Anet. To demonstrate this approach, we applied the framework to the analysis of metadata from the Genomes OnLine Database and produced a biological map of sequenced prokaryotic organisms with three major clusters of metadata that represent pathogens, environmental isolates and plant symbionts.},

abstract = {The structure of a 58 nucleotide ribosomal RNA fragment buries several phosphate groups of a hairpin loop within a large tertiary core. During refinement of an X-ray crystal structure containing this RNA, a potassium ion was found to be contacted by six oxygen atoms from the buried phosphate groups; the ion is contained completely within the solvent-accessible surface of the RNA. The electrostatic potential at the ion chelation site is unusually large, and more than compensates for the substantial energetic penalties associated with partial dehydration of the ion and displacement of delocalized ions. The very large predicted binding free energy, approximately -30 kcal/mol, implies that the site must be occupied for the RNA to fold. These findings agree with previous studies of the ion-dependent folding of tertiary structure in this RNA, which concluded that a monovalent ion was bound in a partially dehydrated environment where Mg2+ could not easily compete for binding. By compensating the unfavorable free energy of buried phosphate groups with a chelated ion, the RNA is able to create a larger and more complex tertiary fold than would be possible otherwise.},

abstract = {A novel thermophilic, heterotrophic bacterium, strain TBF 19.5.1(T), was isolated from oil production fluid at the Troll B oil platform in the North Sea. Cells of strain TBF 19.5.1(T) were non-motile rods with a sheath-like structure, or toga. The strain was Gram-negative and grew at 20-80 degrees C (optimum 65 degrees C), pH 5.5-8.0 (optimum pH 6.8) and NaCl concentrations of 10-60 g l(-1) (optimum 25-30 g l(-1)). For a member of the order Thermotogales, the novel isolate is capable of unprecedented growth at low temperatures, with an optimal doubling time of 175 min (specific growth rate 0.24 h(-1)) and a final optical density of >1.4 when grown on pyruvate at 37 degrees C. Various carbohydrates, proteinaceous compounds and pyruvate served as growth substrates. Thiosulfate, but not elemental sulfur, enhanced growth of the isolate. Sulfate also enhanced growth, but sulfide was not produced. The strain grew in the presence of up to approximately 15 \% oxygen, but only if cysteine was included in the medium. Growth of the isolate was inhibited by acetate, lactate and propionate, while butanol and malate prevented growth. The major fermentation products formed on maltose were hydrogen, carbon dioxide and acetic acid, with traces of ethanol and propionic acid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 42.5 mol\%. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S and 23S rRNA gene sequences as well as 29 protein-coding ORFs placed the strain within the bacterial order Thermotogales. Based on the phylogenetic analyses and the possession of a variety of physiological characteristics not previously found in any species of this order, it is proposed that the strain represents a novel species of a new genus within the family Thermotogaceae, order Thermotogales. The name Kosmotoga olearia gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Kosmotoga olearia is TBF 19.5.1(T) (=DSM 21960(T) =ATCC BAA-1733(T)).},

abstract = {Here, we represent protein structures as residue interacting networks, which are assumed to involve a permanent flow of information between amino acids. By removal of nodes from the protein network, we identify fold centrally conserved residues, which are crucial for sustaining the shortest pathways and thus play key roles in long-range interactions. Analysis of seven protein families (myoglobins, G-protein-coupled receptors, the trypsin class of serine proteases, hemoglobins, oligosaccharide phosphorylases, nuclear receptor ligand-binding domains and retroviral proteases) confirms that experimentally many of these residues are important for allosteric communication. The agreement between the centrally conserved residues, which are key in preserving short path lengths, and residues experimentally suggested to mediate signaling further illustrates that topology plays an important role in network communication. Protein folds have evolved under constraints imposed by function. To maintain function, protein structures need to be robust to mutational events. On the other hand, robustness is accompanied by an extreme sensitivity at some crucial sites. Thus, here we propose that centrally conserved residues, whose removal increases the characteristic path length in protein networks, may relate to the system fragility.},

Two components of the toxin enzymatically modify substrates within the cytosol of mammalian cells: oedema factor (OF) is an adenylate cyclase that impairs host defences through a variety of mechanisms including inhibiting phagocytosis; lethal factor (LF) is a zinc-dependent protease that cleaves mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and causes lysis of macrophages. Protective antigen (PA), the third component, binds to a cellular receptor and mediates delivery of the enzymatic components to the cytosol. Here we describe the cloning of the human PA receptor using a genetic complementation approach. The receptor, termed ATR (anthrax toxin receptor), is a type I membrane protein with an extracellular von Willebrand factor A domain that binds directly to PA. In addition, a soluble version of this domain can protect cells from the action of the toxin.},

Growth is also observed over a wide range of MgSO4 concentrations (10-40 g l(-1)). Aerobic reduction of nitrate without gas production was detected. Cells grew aerobically in a minimal salts medium containing ammonium chloride and glucose. Strain TM(T) produced acid from fructose, glucose, rhamnose, maltose and glycerol. The G+C content of the DNA was 59.5+/-0.3 mol \%. On the basis of polar lipid analysis, the isolate belonged to the genus Haloferax. Analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence showed the highest similarity (>99\%) to be to the type strain Haloferax volcanii. Although the spectrum of antibiotic susceptibility was similar to that of validly described species of the genus Haloferax, the strain could be distinguished from them by its different response to josamycin and rifampicin. Strain TM(T) is unique within the genus Haloferax in producing canthaxanthin. Comparative analysis of phenotypic properties and DNA-DNA hybridization between strain TM(T) and Haloferax species supported the conclusion that TM(T) is a novel species within this genus, for which the name Haloferax alexandrinus sp. nov. is proposed.

NRP heterocyclizations to thiazoles and oxazoles can occur on the elongating framework of acyl-S enzyme intermediates, whereas tandem cyclic PK polyether formation of furans and pyrans can be initiated by post-assembly line epoxidases. Macrocyclizations of NRP, PK, and hybrid NRP-PK scaffolds occur in assembly line chain termination steps. Post-assembly line cascades of enzymatic oxidations also create cross-linked and cyclized architectures that generate the mature scaffolds of natural product antibiotics. The modularity of the natural product assembly lines and permissivity of tailoring enzymes offer prospects for reprogramming to create novel antibiotics with optimized properties.},

abstract = {An obligately aerobic, spherical, non-motile, pale-yellow pigmented bacterium was isolated from a piece of leaf of seagrass, Enhalus acoroides (L.f.) Royle, grown in Okinawa, Japan and was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the novel isolate N5FB36-5(T) shared approximately 96-98 \% sequence similarity with the species of the genus Pelagicoccus of the family Puniceicoccaceae within the phylum 'Verrucomicrobia'. The DNA-DNA relatedness values of strain N5FB36-5(T) with Pelagicoccus mobilis 02PA-Ca-133(T) and Pelagicoccus albus YM14-201(T) were below 70 \%, which is accepted as the phylogenetic definition of a novel species. beta-Lactam antibiotic susceptibility test and amino acid analysis of the cell wall hydrolysates indicated the absence of muramic acid and diaminopimelic acid in the cell walls, which suggested that this strain lacks an ordinary Gram-negative type of peptidoglycan in the cell wall. The DNA G+C content of strain N5FB36-5(T) was 51.6 mol\%; MK-7 was the major menaquinone; and the presence of C(16 : 0), C(16 : 1)omega7c and anteiso-C(15 : 0) as the major cellular fatty acids supported the identification of the novel isolate as a member of the genus Pelagicoccus. On the basis of polyphasic taxonomic data, it was concluded that this strain should be classified as a novel species of the genus Pelagicoccus, for which the name Pelagicoccus croceus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is N5FB36-5(T) (=MBIC08283(T)=KCTC [corrected] 12903(T)).},

abstract = {A pseudoknot forms in an RNA when nucleotides in a loop pair with a region outside the helices that close the loop. Pseudoknots occur relatively rarely in RNA but are highly overrepresented in functionally critical motifs in large catalytic RNAs, in riboswitches, and in regulatory elements of viruses. Pseudoknots are usually excluded from RNA structure prediction algorithms. When included, these pairings are difficult to model accurately, especially in large RNAs, because allowing this structure dramatically increases the number of possible incorrect folds and because it is difficult to search the fold space for an optimal structure. We have developed a concise secondary structure modeling approach that combines SHAPE (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) experimental chemical probing information and a simple, but robust, energy model for the entropic cost of single pseudoknot formation. Structures are predicted with iterative refinement, using a dynamic programming algorithm. This melded experimental and thermodynamic energy function predicted the secondary structures and the pseudoknots for a set of 21 challenging RNAs of known structure ranging in size from 34 to 530 nt. On average, 93\% of known base pairs were predicted, and all pseudoknots in well-folded RNAs were identified.},

abstract = {We have applied laser UV photo-footprinting to characterise kinetically complexes involving the activator protein FIS, RNA polymerase and the tyrT promoter of Escherichia coli. FIS photo-footprints strongly to three binding sites upstream of the core promoter. The polymerase photo-footprints in the near-consensus -35 hexamer on the non-template strand of DNA in a fashion similar to that of stable complexes involving the lacUV5 promoter. The kinetics of the interactions of polymerase alone with the tyrT promoter differ from those observed previously at the lacUV5 promoter. In the absence of FIS, we observe an upstream polymerase-induced signal at -122 within FIS site III that occurs subsequent to changes in the core promoter region and is strongly dependent on negative supercoiling. These observations support the proposal that the upstream region of the promoter is wrapped around the polymerase. We propose that the wrapped DNA allows the polymerase to overcome, at least in part, the barrier to DNA untwisting imparted by the G+C-rich discriminator. We further suggest that FIS plays a similar role and may facilitate polymerase escape.},

abstract = {The adult human intestine contains trillions of bacteria, representing hundreds of species and thousands of subspecies. Little is known about the selective pressures that have shaped and are shaping this community's component species, which are dominated by members of the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes divisions. To examine how the intestinal environment affects microbial genome evolution, we have sequenced the genomes of two members of the normal distal human gut microbiota, Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides distasonis, and by comparison with the few other sequenced gut and non-gut Bacteroidetes, analyzed their niche and habitat adaptations. The results show that lateral gene transfer, mobile elements, and gene amplification have played important roles in affecting the ability of gut-dwelling Bacteroidetes to vary their cell surface, sense their environment, and harvest nutrient resources present in the distal intestine. Our findings show that these processes have been a driving force in the adaptation of Bacteroidetes to the distal gut environment, and emphasize the importance of considering the evolution of humans from an additional perspective, namely the evolution of our microbiomes.},

abstract = {To better understand why aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) have evolved to bind bacterial elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) with uniform affinities, mutant tRNAs with differing affinities for EF-Tu were assayed for decoding on Escherichia coli ribosomes. At saturating EF-Tu concentrations, weaker-binding aa-tRNAs decode their cognate codons similarly to wild-type tRNAs. However, tighter-binding aa-tRNAs show reduced rates of peptide bond formation due to slow release from EF-Tu•GDP. Thus, the affinities of aa-tRNAs for EF-Tu are constrained to be uniform by their need to bind tightly enough to form the ternary complex but weakly enough to release from EF-Tu during decoding. Consistent with available crystal structures, the identity of the esterified amino acid and three base pairs in the T stem of tRNA combine to define the affinity of each aa-tRNA for EF-Tu, both off and on the ribosome.},

abstract = {DNA hairpins consist of two distinct structural domains: a double stranded stem and a single-stranded loop that connect the two strands of the stem. Previous studies of short DNA hairpins have revealed that loop and stem sequences can significantly affect the thermodynamic stability of short DNA hairpins. In this work we present the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the helix-coil transition temperature (T(M)) for 11 16-base, hairpin-forming DNA oligonucleotides. All of the samples form a hairpin with a 6-base pair stem and a four-base loop. In addition, the four base pairs at the end of the stem distal from the loop are the same for every molecule. We have varied loop sequence and identity of the two duplex base pairs adjacent to the loop. Using the change in UV absorption to monitor the conformational state of the oligonucleotide the hairpin-coil transition temperature of these molecules was studied as a function of sodium ion concentration and pressure. From these data we calculated the volume change accompanying the transition. Model-dependent (van't Hoff) transition parameters such as $\Delta$H(vH) and transition volume ($\Delta$V) were estimated from the analysis of conformational transitions. Experiments revealed that the $\Delta$V for denaturation of these molecules range from -2.35 to +6.74 cm(3) mol(-1). The expansibility ($\Delta$$\Delta$V/$\Delta$T) and the pressure dependence of cation release are also presented. The difference in the volume change for this transition is related to the differences in the hydration of these molecules.},

abstract = {Multiple sequence alignments are powerful tools for understanding the structures, functions, and evolutionary histories of linear biological macromolecules (DNA, RNA, and proteins), and for finding homologs in sequence databases. We address several ontological issues related to RNA sequence alignments that are informed by structure. Multiple sequence alignments are usually shown as two-dimensional (2D) matrices, with rows representing individual sequences, and columns identifying nucleotides from different sequences that correspond structurally, functionally, and/or evolutionarily. However, the requirement that sequences and structures correspond nucleotide-by-nucleotide is unrealistic and hinders representation of important biological relationships. High-throughput sequencing efforts are also rapidly making 2D alignments unmanageable because of vertical and horizontal expansion as more sequences are added. Solving the shortcomings of traditional RNA sequence alignments requires explicit annotation of the meaning of each relationship within the alignment. We introduce the notion of "correspondence," which is an equivalence relation between RNA elements in sets of sequences as the basis of an RNA alignment ontology. The purpose of this ontology is twofold: first, to enable the development of new representations of RNA data and of software tools that resolve the expansion problems with current RNA sequence alignments, and second, to facilitate the integration of sequence data with secondary and three-dimensional structural information, as well as other experimental information, to create simultaneously more accurate and more exploitable RNA alignments.},

abstract = {The retrovirus XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus) has been detected in human prostate tumors and in blood samples from patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, but these findings have not been replicated. We hypothesized that an understanding of when and how XMRV first arose might help explain the discrepant results. We studied human prostate cancer cell lines CWR22Rv1 and CWR-R1, which produce XMRV virtually identical to the viruses recently found in patient samples, as well as their progenitor human prostate tumor xenograft (CWR22) that had been passaged in mice. We detected XMRV infection in the two cell lines and in the later passage xenografts, but not in the early passages. In particular, we found that the host mice contained two proviruses, PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2, which share 99.92\% identity with XMRV over >3.2-kilobase stretches of their genomes. We conclude that XMRV was not present in the original CWR22 tumor but was generated by recombination of two proviruses during tumor passaging in mice. The probability that an identical recombinant was generated independently is negligible (\~{}10(-12)); our results suggest that the association of XMRV with human disease is due to contamination of human samples with virus originating from this recombination event.},

abstract = {An autotrophic, hyperthermophilic methanogen (M7T) was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal chimney sample collected on the East Pacific Rise at a depth of 2600 m. The coccoid-shaped cells are flagellated and exhibit a slight tumbling motility. The temperature range for growth at pH 6.5 was 49-89 degrees C, with optimum growth at 80 degrees C. The optimum pH for growth was 6.5, and the optimum NaCl concentration for growth was around 25 g l-1. The new isolate used H2 and CO2 as the only substrates for growth and methane production. Tungsten, selenium and yeast extract stimulated growth significantly. In the presence of CO2 and H2, the organism reduced elemental sulphur to hydrogen sulphide. Growth was inhibited by chloramphenicol and rifampicin, but not by ampicillin, kanamycin, penicillin and streptomycin. The G + C content of the genomic DNA was 31 mol\%. As determined by 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis, this organism was closely related to Methanococcus jannaschii strain JAL-1T. However, despite the high percentage of similarity between their 16S rDNA sequences (97.1\%), the DNA-DNA hybridization levels between these strains were less than 5\%. On the basis of these observations and physiological traits, it is proposed that this organism should be placed in a new species, Methanococcus vulcanius. The type strain is M7T (= DSM 12094T). During the course of this study, the 16S rDNA sequence analysis placed Methanococcus sp. strain AG86T (= DSM 4213T) as a close relative of M. jannaschii strain JAL-1T. However, the weak level of DNA-DNA hybridization with this strain (< 10\%) allowed the proposal that strain AG86T also constitutes a new species, Methanococcus fervens.},

We utilized an optical trap to measure the mechanical force to rupture tRNA from the ribosome. We measured the rupture forces of aminoacyl tRNA or peptidyl tRNA mimic from the ribosome in a prepeptidyl transfer state, the pretranslocational state, and the posttranslocational state. In addition, we measured the interaction strength between the ribosome and aminoacyl-tRNA in presence of viomycin. Based on the interaction strengths between the ribosome and tRNA under these conditions, 1), we concluded that tRNA interaction with the 30S subunit is far more important than the interaction with the 50S subunit in the mechanism of translocation; and 2), we propose a mechanism of translocation where the ribosomal ratchet motion, with the aid of EF-G, drives tRNA translocation.},

The genomic sequences of ten newly isolated mycobacteriophages suggest that the bacteriophage population as a whole is amazingly diverse and may represent the largest unexplored reservoir of sequence information in the biosphere. Genomic comparison of these mycobacteriophages contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms of viral evolution and provides compelling evidence for the role of illegitimate recombination in horizontal genetic exchange. The promiscuity of these recombination events results in the inclusion of many unexpected genes including those implicated in mycobacterial latency, the cellular and immune responses to mycobacterial infections, and autoimmune diseases such as human lupus. While the role of phages as vehicles of toxin genes is well established, these observations suggest a much broader involvement of phages in bacterial virulence and the host response to bacterial infections.},

abstract = {The RepA protein from bacteriophage P1 binds DNA to initiate replication. RepA covers one face of the DNA and the binding site has a completely conserved T that directly faces RepA from the minor groove at position +7. Although all four bases can be distinguished through contacts in the major groove of B-form DNA, contacts in the minor groove cannot easily distinguish between A and T bases. Therefore the 100\% conservation at this position cannot be accounted for by direct contacts approaching into the minor groove of B-form DNA. RepA binding sites with modified base pairs at position +7 were used to investigate contacts with RepA. The data show that RepA contacts the N3 proton of T at position +7 and that the T=A hydrogen bonds are already broken in the DNA before RepA binds. To accommodate the N3 proton contact the T(+7 )/A(+7)((')) base pair must be distorted. One possibility is that T(+7) is flipped out of the helix. The energetics of the contact allows RepA to distinguish between all four bases, accounting for the observed high sequence conservation. After protein binding, base pair distortion or base flipping could initiate DNA melting as the second step in DNA replication.},

Cell culture experiments revealed that patient-derived XMRV is infectious and that both cell-associated and cell-free transmission of the virus are possible. Secondary viral infections were established in uninfected primary lymphocytes and indicator cell lines after their exposure to activated PBMCs, B cells, T cells, or plasma derived from CFS patients. These findings raise the possibility that XMRV may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of CFS.},

abstract = {The expression of photosynthesis genes in the facultatively photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides is controlled by the oxygen tension and by light quantity. Two photoreceptor proteins, AppA and CryB, have been identified in the past, which are involved in this regulation. AppA senses light by its N-terminal BLUF domain, its C-terminal part binds heme and is redox-responsive. Through its interaction to the transcriptional repressor PpsR the AppA photoreceptor controls expression of photosynthesis genes. The cryptochrome-like protein CryB was shown to affect regulation of photosynthesis genes, but the underlying signal chain remained unknown. Here we show that CryB interacts with the C-terminal domain of AppA and modulates the binding of AppA to the transcriptional repressor PpsR in a light-dependent manner. Consequently, binding of the transcription factor PpsR to its DNA target is affected by CryB. In agreement with this, all genes of the PpsR regulon showed altered expression levels in a CryB deletion strain after blue-light illumination. These results elucidate for the first time how a bacterial cryptochrome affects gene expression.},

abstract = {Pathogens must be able to overcome both host defenses and antimicrobial treatment in order to successfully infect and maintain colonization of the host. One way fungi accomplish this feat and overcome intercellular toxin accumulation is efflux pumps, in particular ATP-binding cassette transporters and transporters of the major facilitator superfamily. Members of these two superfamilies remove many toxic compounds by coupling transport with ATP hydrolysis or a proton gradient, respectively. Fungal genomes encode a plethora of members of these families of transporters compared to other organisms. In this review we discuss the role these two fungal superfamilies of transporters play in virulence and resistance to antifungal agents. These efflux transporters are responsible not only for export of compounds involved in pathogenesis such as secondary metabolites, but also export of host-derived antimicrobial compounds. In addition, we examine the current knowledge of these transporters in resistance of pathogens to clinically relevant antifungal agents.},

abstract = {Although most DNA polymerases discriminate against ribonucleotide triphosphaets (rNTPs) during DNA synthesis, recent studies have shown that large numbers of ribonucleotides are incorporated into the eukaryotic nuclear genome. Here, we investigate how a DNA polymerase can stably incorporate an rNTP. The X-ray crystal structure of a variant of human DNA polymerase $\lambda$ reveals that the rNTP occupies the nucleotide binding pocket without distortion of the active site, despite an unfavorable interaction between the 2'-O and Tyr505 backbone carbonyl. This indicates an energetically unstable binding state for the rNTP, stabilized by additional protein-nucleotide interactions. Supporting this idea is the 200-fold lower catalytic efficiency for rNTP relative to deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) incorporation, reflecting a higher apparent Km value for the rNTP. Furthermore, distortion observed in the structure of the post-catalytic product complex suggests that once the bond between the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-phosphates of the rNTP is broken, the unfavorable binding state of the ribonucleotide cannot be maintained. Finally, structural and biochemical evaluation of dNTP insertion onto an ribonucleotide monophosphate (rNMP)-terminated primer indicates that a primer-terminal rNMP does not impede extension. The results are relevant to how ribonucleotides are incorporated into DNA in vivo, during replication and during repair, perhaps especially in non-proliferating cells when rNTP:dNTP ratios are high.},

An extreme manifestation of such response is nascent peptide-dependent ribosome stalling, involved in the regulation of gene expression. The molecular mechanisms of programmed translation arrest are unclear. By analyzing ribosome stalling at the regulatory cistron of the antibiotic resistance gene ermA, we uncovered a carefully orchestrated cooperation between the ribosomal exit tunnel and the A-site of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) in halting translation. The presence of an inducing antibiotic and a specific nascent peptide in the exit tunnel abrogate the ability of the PTC to catalyze peptide bond formation with a particular subset of amino acids. The extent of the conferred A-site selectivity is modulated by the C-terminal segment of the nascent peptide, where the third-from-last residue plays a critical role.},

The intein active site(s) are formed by folding of the intein within the precursor, which brings together the splice junctions and internal intein residues that assist catalysis. Inteins with non-canonical catalytic residues splice by modified pathways. Understanding intein proteolytic cleavage and ligation activities has led to the development of many novel applications in the fields of protein engineering, enzymology, microarray production, target detection and activation of transgenes in plants. Recent advances include intein-mediated attachment of proteins to solid supports for microarray or western blot analysis, linking nucleic acids to proteins and controllable splicing, which converts inteins into molecular switches.},

Analysis of the 16S rRNA secondary structure regions revealed a fall in the A:U base-pair content in step with the increase in T(opt) that was much steeper than that of mismatched base-pairs, which are thermodynamically less stable. These findings indicate that the 16S rRNA sequences of thermophiles and psychrophiles are under a strong thermo-adaptive pressure, and that structure-function constraints play a crucial role in determining their 16S rRNA nucleotide composition. The derived relationship between uracil content and T(opt) was used to develop an algorithm to predict the T(opt) values of uncultured prokaryotes lacking cultured close relatives and belonging to the phyla predominantly containing thermophiles. This algorithm may be useful in guiding the design of cultivation conditions for hitherto uncultured microbes.},

This is the first reported discovery of a case of threefold excess information, and it implies that at least three proteins bind independently to the repeats. In support of this observation, other workers have shown that three polypeptides bind to this region, but only one, SopB, is known to bind independently of other factors. Identification of the other two proteins should help us to understand the mechanism of plasmid partitioning during cell division.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in various biological processes and human diseases. The development of strong low-molecular weight inhibitors of specific miRNAs is thus expected to be useful in providing tools for basic research or in generating promising new therapeutic drugs. We have previously described the development of 'Tough Decoy (TuD) RNA' molecules, which achieve the long-term suppression of specific miRNA activity in mammalian cells when expressed from a lentivirus vector. In our current study, we describe new synthetic miRNA inhibitors, designated as S-TuD (Synthetic TuD), which are composed of two fully 2'-O-methylated RNA strands. Each of these strands includes a miRNA-binding site. Following the hybridization of paired strands, the resultant S-TuD forms a secondary structure with two stems, which resembles the corresponding TuD RNA molecule. By analyzing the effects of S-TuD against miR-21, miR-200c, miR-16 and miR-106b, we have elucidated the critical design features of S-TuD molecules that will provide optimum inhibitory effects following transfection into human cell lines. We further show that the inhibitory effects of a single transfection of S-TuD-miR200c are quite long-lasting (>7 days) and induce partial EMT, the full establishment of which requires 11 days when using a lentivirus vector that expresses TuD-miR200c continuously.},

Adults of the smallest flying insects of the parasitic wasp genus Megaphragma (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) have only 339-372 nuclei in the central nervous system, i.e., their ganglia, including the brain, consist almost exclusively of processes of neurons. In contrast, their pupae have ganglia more typical of other insects, with about 7400 nuclei in the central nervous system. During the final phases of pupal development, most neuronal cell bodies lyse. As adults, these insects have many fewer nucleated neurons, a small number of cell bodies in different stages of lysis, and about 7000 anucleate cells. Although most neurons lack nuclei, these insects exhibit many important behaviors, including flight and searching for hosts.},

abstract = {Because of the molecular complexity of the ribosome and protein synthesis, it is a challenge to imagine how translation could have evolved from a primitive RNA World. Two specific suggestions are made here to help to address this, involving separate evolution of the peptidyl transferase and decoding functions. First, it is proposed that translation originally arose not to synthesize functional proteins, but to provide simple (perhaps random) peptides that bound to RNA, increasing its available structure space, and therefore its functional capabilities. Second, it is proposed that the decoding site of the ribosome evolved from a mechanism for duplication of RNA. This process involved homodimeric "duplicator RNAs," resembling the anticodon arms of tRNAs, which directed ligation of trinucleotides in response to an RNA template.},

abstract = {Blood Falls is the surface manifestation of brine released from below the Taylor Glacier, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. Geochemical analyses of Blood Falls show that this brine is of a marine origin. The discovery that 74\% of clones and isolates from Blood Falls share high 16S rRNA gene sequence homology with phylotypes from marine systems supports this contention. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone library was dominated by a phylotype that had 99\% sequence identity with Thiomicrospira arctica (46\% of the library), a psychrophilic marine autotrophic sulfur oxidizer. The remainder of the library contained phylotypes related to the classes Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria and the division Bacteroidetes and included clones whose closest cultured relatives metabolize iron and sulfur compounds. These findings are consistent with the high iron and sulfate concentrations detected in Blood Falls, which are likely due to the interactions of the subglacial brine with the underlying iron-rich bedrock. Our results, together with previous reports, suggest that the brine below the Taylor Glacier hosts a viable ecosystem with microorganisms capable of growth, supported by chemical energy present in reduced iron and sulfur compounds. The metabolic and phylogenetic structure of this subglacial microbial assemblage appears to be controlled by glacier hydrology, bedrock lithology, and the preglacial ecosystem.},

A probabilistic approach was applied, and an algorithm and its implementation in a computer program that detects and analyzes all the base pairs contained in RNA 3D structures were developed. The algorithm objectively distinguishes among canonical and non-canonical base pairing types formed by three, two and one hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), as well as those containing bifurcated and C-H.X...H-bonds. The nodes of a bipartite graph are used to encode the donor and acceptor atoms of a 3D structure. The capacities of the edges correspond to probabilities computed from the geometry of the donor and acceptor groups to form H-bonds. The maximum flow from donors to acceptors directly identifies base pairs and their types. A complete repertoire of base pairing types was built from the detected H-bonds of all X-ray crystal structures of a resolution of 3.0 A or better, including the large and small ribosomal subunits. The base pairing types are labeled using an extension of the nomenclature recently introduced by Leontis and Westhof. The probabilistic method was implemented in MC-Annotate, an RNA structure analysis computer program used to determine the base pairing parameters of the 3D modeling system MC-Sym.},

abstract = {Cancer therapeutics still fall far short of our goals for treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Until recently, almost all cancer drugs were crude cytotoxic agents that discriminate poorly between cancer cells and normally dividing cells. The development of targeted biologics that recognize tumor cell surface antigens and of specific inhibitors of pathways dysregulated in cancer cells or normal cellular pathways on which a cancer cell differentially depends has provided hope for converting our increasing understanding of cellular transformation into intelligently designed anticancer therapeutics. However, new drug development is painfully slow, and the pipeline of new therapeutics is thin. The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi), a ubiquitous cellular pathway of gene regulation that is dysregulated in cancer cells, provides an exciting opportunity for relatively rapid and revolutionary approaches to cancer drug design. Small RNAs that harness the RNAi machinery may become the next new class of drugs for treating a variety of diseases. Although it has only been 9 years since RNAi was shown to work in mammalian cells, about a dozen phase I to III clinical studies have already been initiated, including four for cancer. So far there has been no unexpected toxicity and suggestions of benefit in one phase II study. However, the obstacles for RNAi-based cancer therapeutics are substantial. This article will discuss how the endogenous RNAi machinery might be harnessed for cancer therapeutics, why academic researchers and biotech and pharmaceutical companies are so excited, and what the obstacles are and how they might be overcome.},

Light microscopy and negative staining in a transmission electron microscope showed that the cells were rod-shaped, approximately 2.8-4.1 microm long by 0.9-1.7 microm wide in size and produced large quantities of extracellular fibrillar material. Additionally, following growth in batch culture, transmission electron microscopy showed that many cells plasmolysed. Stationary-phase cells were more variable in size and shape. The DNA G+C content was 40.0 mol\%. The most abundant fatty acids were 15 : 0 iso (22.5 \%), followed by 16 : 1omega5c (16.9 \%) and 15 : 0 iso 2-OH (16.5 \%). Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene showed that the strain was a member of the family 'Flexibacteraceae' of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides group.

Interestingly, >76\% of uracil modifications are located on its 5-position. We have investigated the natural 5-methoxy (5-O-CH(3)) modification of uracil in the context of A-form oligonucleotide duplex. Our X-ray crystal structure indicates first a H-bond formation between the uracil 5-O-CH(3) and its 5'-phosphate. This novel H-bond is not observed when the oxygen of 5-O-CH(3) is replaced with a larger atom (selenium or sulfur). The 5-O-CH(3) modification does not cause significant structure and stability alterations. Moreover, our computational study is consistent with the experimental observation. The investigation on the uracil 5-position demonstrates the importance of this RNA modification at the atomic level. Our finding suggests a general interaction between the nucleobase and backbone and reveals a plausible function of the tRNA 5-O-CH(3) modification, which might potentially rigidify the local conformation and facilitates translation.},

We have performed an extensive re-annotation of the genome of P. abyssi to obtain an integrated view of its phylogeny, molecular biology and physiology. Many new functions are predicted for both informational and operational proteins. Moreover, several candidate genes have been identified that might encode missing links in key metabolic pathways, some of which have unique biochemical features. The great majority of Pyrococcus proteins are typical archaeal proteins and their phylogenetic pattern agrees with its position near the root of the archaeal tree. However, proteins probably from bacterial origin, including some from mesophilic bacteria, are also present in the P. abyssi genome.},

Groundbreaking studies in structural biology and kinetics have placed important constraints on ribosome structural dynamics. However, a gulf remains between static structures and time dependent data. In particular, X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM studies produce static models of the ribosome in various states, but lack dynamic information. Single molecule studies produce information on the rates of transitions between these states but do not have high-resolution spatial information. Computational studies have aided in bridging this gap by providing atomic resolution simulations of structural fluctuations and transitions between configurations.},

@article{Ollis2012,
abstract = {The TonB system of gram-negative bacteria energizes the active transport of diverse nutrients through high-affinity TonB-gated outer membrane transporters using energy derived from the cytoplasmic membrane proton motive force. Cytoplasmic membrane proteins ExbB and ExbD harness the proton gradient to energize TonB, which directly contacts and transmits this energy to ligand-loaded transporters. In Escherichia coli, the periplasmic domain of ExbD appears to transition from proton motive force-independent to proton motive force-dependent interactions with TonB, catalyzing the conformational changes of TonB. A 10-residue deletion scanning analysis showed that while all regions except the extreme amino terminus of ExbD were indispensable for function, distinct roles for the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of the ExbD periplasmic domain were evident. Like residue D25 in the ExbD transmembrane domain, periplasmic residues 42 to 61 facilitated the conformational response of ExbD to proton motive force. This region appears to be important for transmitting signals between the ExbD transmembrane domain and carboxy terminus. The carboxy terminus, encompassing periplasmic residues 62 to 141, was required for initial assembly with the periplasmic domain of TonB, a stage of interaction required for ExbD to transmit its conformational response to proton motive force to TonB. Residues 92 to 121 were important for all three interactions previously observed for formaldehyde-cross-linked ExbD: ExbD homodimers, TonB-ExbD heterodimers, and ExbD-ExbB heterodimers. The distinct requirement of this ExbD region for interaction with ExbB raised the possibility of direct interaction with the few residues of ExbB known to occupy the periplasm.},

abstract = {The underlying basis for the accuracy of protein synthesis has been the subject of over four decades of investigation. Recent biochemical and structural data make it possible to understand at least in outline the structural basis for tRNA selection, in which codon recognition by cognate tRNA results in the hydrolysis of GTP by EF-Tu over 75 A away. The ribosome recognizes the geometry of codon-anticodon base pairing at the first two positions but monitors the third, or wobble position, less stringently. Part of the additional binding energy of cognate tRNA is used to induce conformational changes in the ribosome that stabilize a transition state for GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu and subsequently result in accelerated accommodation of tRNA into the peptidyl transferase center. The transition state for GTP hydrolysis is characterized, among other things, by a distorted tRNA. This picture explains a large body of data on the effect of antibiotics and mutations on translational fidelity. However, many fundamental questions remain, such as the mechanism of activation of GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu, and the relationship between decoding and frameshifting.},

Thus, as the number of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data sets and the variety of protocols for this technology grow rapidly, it is becoming increasingly pertinent to develop tools that can analyze and visualize this sequence data in the context of RNA secondary structure. Here, we present Sequencing Annotation and Visualization of RNA structures (SAVoR), a web server, which seamlessly links RNA structure predictions with sequencing data and genomic annotations to produce highly informative and annotated models of RNA secondary structure. SAVoR accepts read alignment data from RNA-seq experiments and computes a series of per-base values such as read abundance and sequence variant frequency. These values can then be visualized on a customizable secondary structure model. SAVoR is freely available at http://tesla.pcbi.upenn.edu/savor.},

abstract = {Translation initiation is a major determinant of the overall expression level of a gene. The translation of functionally active protein requires the messenger RNA to be positioned on the ribosome such that the start/initiation codon will be read first and in the correct frame. Little is known about the molecular basis for the interaction of mRNA with the ribosome at different states of translation. Recent crystal structures of the ribosomal subunits, the empty 70S ribosome and the 70S ribosome containing functional ligands have provided information about the general organization of the ribosome and its functional centres. Here we compare the X-ray structures of eight ribosome complexes modelling the translation initiation, post-initiation and elongation states. In the initiation and post-initiation complexes, the presence of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) duplex causes strong anchoring of the 5'-end of mRNA onto the platform of the 30S subunit, with numerous interactions between mRNA and the ribosome. Conversely, the 5' end of the 'elongator' mRNA lacking SD interactions is flexible, suggesting a different exit path for mRNA during elongation. After the initiation of translation, but while an SD interaction is still present, mRNA moves in the 3'-->5' direction with simultaneous clockwise rotation and lengthening of the SD duplex, bringing it into contact with ribosomal protein S2.},

abstract = {The ribosome is a macromolecular assembly that is responsible for protein biosynthesis following genetic instructions in all organisms. It is composed of two unequal subunits: the smaller subunit binds messenger RNA and the anticodon end of transfer RNAs, and helps to decode the mRNA; and the larger subunit interacts with the amino-acid-carrying end of tRNAs and catalyses the formation of the peptide bonds. After peptide-bond formation, elongation factor G (EF-G) binds to the ribosome, triggering the translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from its aminoacyl site to the peptidyl site, and movement of mRNA by one codon. Here we analyse three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy maps of the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome in various functional states, and show that both EF-G binding and subsequent GTP hydrolysis lead to ratchet-like rotations of the small 30S subunit relative to the large 50S subunit. Furthermore, our finding indicates a two-step mechanism of translocation: first, relative rotation of the subunits and opening of the mRNA channel following binding of GTP to EF-G; and second, advance of the mRNA/(tRNA)2 complex in the direction of the rotation of the 30S subunit, following GTP hydrolysis.},

abstract = {Numerous prokaryote genomes contain structures known as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs), composed of 25-50 bp repeats separated by unique sequence spacers of similar length. CRISPR structures are found in the vicinity of four genes named cas1 to cas4. In silico analysis revealed another cluster of three genes associated with CRISPR structures in many bacterial species, named here as cas1B, cas5 and cas6, and also revealed a certain number of spacers that have homology with extant genes, most frequently derived from phages, but also derived from other extrachromosomal elements. Sequence analysis of CRISPR structures from 24 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus vestibularis confirmed the homology of spacers with extrachromosomal elements. Phage sensitivity of S. thermophilus strains appears to be correlated with the number of spacers in the CRISPR locus the strain carries. The authors suggest that the spacer elements are the traces of past invasions by extrachromosomal elements, and hypothesize that they provide the cell immunity against phage infection, and more generally foreign DNA expression, by coding an anti-sense RNA. The presence of gene fragments in CRISPR structures and the nuclease motifs in cas genes of both cluster types suggests that CRISPR formation involves a DNA degradation step.},

Psychrophiles include both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and thus represent a significant proportion of the living world. These organisms produce cold-evolved enzymes that are partially able to cope with the reduction in chemical reaction rates induced by low temperatures. As a rule, cold-active enzymes display a high catalytic efficiency, associated however, with a low thermal stability. In most cases, the adaptation to cold is achieved through a reduction in the activation energy that possibly originates from an increased flexibility of either a selected area or of the overall protein structure. This enhanced plasticity seems in turn to be induced by the weak thermal stability of psychrophilic enzymes. The adaptation strategies are beginning to be understood thanks to recent advances in the elucidation of the molecular characteristics of cold-adapted enzymes derived from X-ray crystallography, protein engineering and biophysical methods. Psychrophilic organisms and their enzymes have, in recent years, increasingly attracted the attention of the scientific community due to their peculiar properties that render them particularly useful in investigating the possible relationship existing between stability, flexibility and specific activity and as valuable tools for biotechnological purposes.},

abstract = {Recently, the ability to interact with messenger RNA (mRNA) has been reported for a number of known RNA-binding proteins, but surprisingly also for different proteins without recognizable RNA binding domains including several transcription factors and metabolic enzymes. Moreover, direct binding to cognate mRNAs has been detected for multiple proteins, thus creating a strong impetus to search for functional significance and basic physico-chemical principles behind such interactions. Here, we derive interaction preferences between amino acids and RNA bases by analyzing binding interfaces in the known 3D structures of protein-RNA complexes. By applying this tool to human proteome, we reveal statistically significant matching between the composition of mRNA sequences and base-binding preferences of protein sequences they code for. For example, purine density profiles of mRNA sequences mirror guanine affinity profiles of cognate protein sequences with quantitative accuracy (median Pearson correlation coefficient R = -0.80 across the entire human proteome). Notably, statistically significant anti-matching is seen only in the case of adenine. Our results provide strong evidence for the stereo-chemical foundation of the genetic code and suggest that mRNAs and cognate proteins may in general be directly complementary to each other and associate, especially if unstructured.},

abstract = {Here, we analyze the thermodynamic parameters and their correlations in families containing homologous thermophilic and mesophilic proteins which show reversible two-state folding <--> unfolding transitions between the native and the denatured states. For the proteins in these families, the melting temperatures correlate with the maximal protein stability change (between the native and the denatured states) as well as with the enthalpic and entropic changes at the melting temperature. In contrast, the heat capacity change is uncorrelated with the melting temperature. These and additional results illustrate that higher melting temperatures are largely obtained via an upshift and broadening of the protein stability curves. Both thermophilic and mesophilic proteins are maximally stable around room temperature. However, the maximal stabilities of thermophilic proteins are considerably greater than those of their mesophilic homologues. At the living temperatures of their respective source organisms, homologous thermophilic and mesophilic proteins have similar stabilities. The protein stability at the living temperature of the source organism does not correlate with the living temperature of the protein. We tie thermodynamic observations to microscopics via the hydrophobic effect and a two-state model of the water structure. We conclude that, to achieve higher stability and greater resistance to high and low temperatures, specific interactions, particularly electrostatic, should be engineered into the protein. The effect of these specific interactions is largely reflected in an increased enthalpy change at the melting temperature.},

The base pairs include size-expanded analogs of thymine and of adenine, both extended by the width of a benzene ring (2.4 A). The expanded-diameter double helices are more thermodynamically stable than the Watson-Crick helix, likely because of enhanced base stacking. Structural data confirm a right-handed, double-stranded, and base-paired helical form. Because of the larger base size, all the pairs of this helical system are fluorescent, which suggests practical applications in detection of natural DNA and RNA.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Today many non-coding RNAs are known to play an active role in various important biological processes. Since RNA's functionality is correlated with specific structural motifs that are often conserved in phylogenetically related molecules, computational prediction of RNA structure should ideally be based on a set of homologous primary structures. But many available RNA secondary structure prediction programs that use sequence alignments do not consider pseudoknots or their estimations consist on a single structure without information on uncertainty. RESULTS: In this paper we present a method that takes advantage of the evolutionary history of a group of aligned RNA sequences for sampling consensus secondary structures, including pseudoknots, according to their approximate posterior probability. We investigate the benefit of using evolutionary history and demonstrate the competitiveness of our method compared to similar methods based on RNase P RNA sequences and simulated data.

Each person can be viewed as an island-like "patch" of habitat occupied by microbial assemblages formed by the fundamental processes of community ecology: dispersal, local diversification, environmental selection, and ecological drift. Community assembly theory, and metacommunity theory in particular, provides a framework for understanding the ecological dynamics of the human microbiome, such as compositional variability within and between hosts. We explore three core scenarios of human microbiome assembly: development in infants, representing assembly in previously unoccupied habitats; recovery from antibiotics, representing assembly after disturbance; and invasion by pathogens, representing assembly in the context of invasive species. Judicious application of ecological theory may lead to improved strategies for restoring and maintaining the microbiota and the crucial health-associated ecosystem services that it provides.},

abstract = {A gram-negative, rod- to oval-shaped, aerotolerant anaerobic bacterium was isolated from an anaerobic enrichment inoculated with sediment taken from below the cyanobacterial mat of a high-salinity pond near Bratina Island on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica. The organism was positive for terminal oxidase and catalase and was motile by means of a polar flagellum. Optimal growth of anaerobic cultures occurred at 12 degrees C, at pH 6.5, and at an NaCl concentration of 3\% (w/v). Of a variety of polysaccharides tested, only starch and glycogen supported growth. No growth was observed on cellulosic substrates and xylan, and the organism was unable to attack esculin. Monosaccharides and disaccharides, including the cyanobacterial cell-wall constituent N-acetyl glucosamine, were fermented. Per 100 mol of hexose, the following products (in mol) were formed: acetate, 60; formate, 130; ethanol, 56; lactate, 73; CO2, 15; and butyrate, 2. Propionate, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol and succinate were not detectable in the culture medium (< 1 mol per 100 mol of monomer). Hydrogen was not detected in the head space (detection limit < 10(-5) atm). Growth yields in aerobic static liquid cultures were slightly higher than those in anaerobic culture, and fermentation favoured acetate at the expense of electron sink products. Growth was inhibited in aerobic shaking cultures, and the organism did not utilize nitrate or sulfate as electron acceptors. The G+C content of the DNA from the bacterium was 42.8 mol\%. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that the organism is a member of the gamma-subgroup of Proteobacteria, but that it is distinct from other members of this group based on the sequence of its 16S rRNA gene, mol\% G+C, morphology, and physiological and biochemical characteristics. It is designated as a new genus and species; the type strain is star-1 (DSM 10704).},

Fusidic acid traps EF-G in a conformation intermediate between the guanosine triphosphate and guanosine diphosphate forms. The interaction of EF-G with ribosomal elements implicated in stimulating catalysis, such as the L10-L12 stalk and the L11 region, and of domain IV of EF-G with the tRNA at the peptidyl-tRNA binding site (P site) and with mRNA shed light on the role of these elements in EF-G function.

abstract = {It is generally accepted that functionally important RNA structure is more conserved than sequence due to compensatory mutations that may alter the sequence without disrupting the structure. For small RNA molecules sequence-structure relationships are relatively well understood. However, structural bioinformatics of mRNAs is still in its infancy due to a virtual absence of experimental data. This report presents the first quantitative assessment of sequence-structure divergence in the coding regions of mRNA molecules based on recently published transcriptome-wide experimental determination of their base paring patterns. Structural resemblance in paralogous mRNA pairs quickly drops as sequence identity decreases from 100\% to 85-90\%. Structures of mRNAs sharing sequence identity below roughly 85\% are essentially uncorrelated. This outcome is in dramatic contrast to small functional non-coding RNAs where sequence and structure divergence are correlated at very low levels of sequence similarity. The fact that very similar mRNA sequences can have vastly different secondary structures may imply that the particular global shape of base paired elements in coding regions does not play a major role in modulating gene expression and translation efficiency. Apparently, the need to maintain stable three-dimensional structures of encoded proteins places a much higher evolutionary pressure on mRNA sequences than on their RNA structures.},

This study determined whether Legionella pneumophila can colonize and grow in biofilms with and without an association with Hartmannella vermiformis. The laboratory model used a rotating disc reactor at a retention time of 6.7 h to grow biofilms on stainless steel coupons. The biofilm was composed of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and a Flavobacterium sp. The levels of L. pneumophila cells present in the biofilm were monitored for 15 d, with and without the presence of H. vermiformis, and it was found that, although unable to replicate in the absence of H. vermiformis, L. pneumophila was able to persist.},

Here, using random shotgun sequencing of DNA from a natural acidophilic biofilm, we report reconstruction of near-complete genomes of Leptospirillum group II and Ferroplasma type II, and partial recovery of three other genomes. This was possible because the biofilm was dominated by a small number of species populations and the frequency of genomic rearrangements and gene insertions or deletions was relatively low. Because each sequence read came from a different individual, we could determine that single-nucleotide polymorphisms are the predominant form of heterogeneity at the strain level. The Leptospirillum group II genome had remarkably few nucleotide polymorphisms, despite the existence of low-abundance variants. The Ferroplasma type II genome seems to be a composite from three ancestral strains that have undergone homologous recombination to form a large population of mosaic genomes. Analysis of the gene complement for each organism revealed the pathways for carbon and nitrogen fixation and energy generation, and provided insights into survival strategies in an extreme environment.},

abstract = {Single-stranded RNA viruses encompass broad classes of infectious agents and cause the common cold, cancer, AIDS and other serious health threats. Viral replication is regulated at many levels, including the use of conserved genomic RNA structures. Most potential regulatory elements in viral RNA genomes are uncharacterized. Here we report the structure of an entire HIV-1 genome at single nucleotide resolution using SHAPE, a high-throughput RNA analysis technology. The genome encodes protein structure at two levels. In addition to the correspondence between RNA and protein primary sequences, a correlation exists between high levels of RNA structure and sequences that encode inter-domain loops in HIV proteins. This correlation suggests that RNA structure modulates ribosome elongation to promote native protein folding. Some simple genome elements previously shown to be important, including the ribosomal gag-pol frameshift stem-loop, are components of larger RNA motifs. We also identify organizational principles for unstructured RNA regions, including splice site acceptors and hypervariable regions. These results emphasize that the HIV-1 genome and, potentially, many coding RNAs are punctuated by previously unrecognized regulatory motifs and that extensive RNA structure constitutes an important component of the genetic code.},

A reliable metric for quantifying residue conservation is desirable. Over the last two decades many such scores have been proposed, but none has emerged as a generally accepted standard. This work surveys the range of scores that biologists, biochemists, and, more recently, bioinformatics workers have developed, and reviews the intrinsic problems associated with developing and evaluating such a score. A general formula is proposed that may be used to compare the properties of different particular conservation scores or as a measure of conservation in its own right.},

abstract = {How do genetic systems gain information by evolutionary processes? Answering this question precisely requires a robust, quantitative measure of information. Fortunately, 50 years ago Claude Shannon defined information as a decrease in the uncertainty of a receiver. For molecular systems, uncertainty is closely related to entropy and hence has clear connections to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. These aspects of information theory have allowed the development of a straightforward and practical method of measuring information in genetic control systems. Here this method is used to observe information gain in the binding sites for an artificial 'protein' in a computer simulation of evolution. The simulation begins with zero information and, as in naturally occurring genetic systems, the information measured in the fully evolved binding sites is close to that needed to locate the sites in the genome. The transition is rapid, demonstrating that information gain can occur by punctuated equilibrium.},

In recent years, many methods addressed this challenge, ranging from cycle decomposition and fragment assembly to molecular dynamics simulations. However, their predictions remain fragile and limited to small RNAs. To expand the range and accuracy of these techniques, we need to develop algorithms that will enable to use all the structural information available. In particular, the energetic contribution of secondary structure interactions is now well documented, but the quantification of non-canonical interactions-those shaping the tertiary structure-is poorly understood. Nonetheless, even if a complete RNA tertiary structure energy model is currently unavailable, we now have catalogues of local 3D structural motifs including non-canonical base pairings. A practical objective is thus to develop techniques enabling us to use this knowledge for robust RNA tertiary structure predictors.},

From a genomic perspective, cold adaptation is suggested in several broad categories involving changes to the cell membrane fluidity, uptake and synthesis of compounds conferring cryotolerance, and strategies to overcome temperature-dependent barriers to carbon uptake. Modeling of three-dimensional protein homology from bacteria representing a range of optimal growth temperatures suggests changes to proteome composition that may enhance enzyme effectiveness at low temperatures. Comparative genome analyses suggest that the psychrophilic lifestyle is most likely conferred not by a unique set of genes but by a collection of synergistic changes in overall genome content and amino acid composition.},

It is suggested here that in an environment characterized by a low heat content (enthalpy) and at temperatures that strongly slowdown molecular motions, the cold-adapted biological systems rely on a larger disorder to maintain macromolecular dynamics and function. Such pre-eminent involvement of entropy is observed in the experimental results and, from a macroscopic point of view, is also reflected for instance by the steric hindrances introduced by cis-unsaturated and branched lipids to maintain membrane fluidity, by the loose conformation of psychrophilic proteins or by the local destabilization of tRNA by dihydrouridine in psychrophilic bacteria.},

Rapid recycling of EF-Tu, catalyzed by EF-Ts, is required for efficient protein synthesis in vivo. Here we report a combined theoretical and experimental approach aimed at identifying three-dimensional communication networks in EF-Tu. As an example, we focus on the mechanistic role of second-shell residue Asp(109). We constructed full-length structural models of EF-Tu from Escherichia coli in the GDP-/GTP-bound state and performed several 10-ns-long molecular-dynamics simulations. During these simulations, the side chain of Asp(109) formed a previously undetected transient hydrogen bond to His(22), an invariant residue in the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop). To experimentally validate our molecular-dynamics results and further analyze the role of this hydrogen bond, we determined all rate constants for the multistep reaction between EF-Tu (wild-type and two mutants), EF-Ts, GDP, and GTP using the stopped-flow technique. This mutational analysis revealed that the side chain of Asp(109) is important for acceleration of GDP, but not for GTP dissociation by EF-Ts. The possibility that the Asp(109) side chain has a role in transition-state stabilization and coupling of P-loop movements with rearrangements at the base side of the nucleotide is discussed.},

abstract = {Time series studies show that hot temperatures are associated with increased death rates in the short term. In light of evidence of adaptation to usual temperature but higher deaths at unusual temperatures, a long-term exposure relevant to mortality might be summertime temperature variability, which is expected to increase with climate change. We investigated whether the standard deviation (SD) of summer (June-August) temperatures was associated with survival in four cohorts of persons over age 65 y with predisposing diseases in 135 US cities. Using Medicare data (1985-2006), we constructed cohorts of persons hospitalized with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and myocardial infarction. City-specific yearly summer temperature variance was linked to the individuals during follow-up in each city and was treated as a time-varying exposure. We applied a Cox proportional hazard model for each cohort within each city, adjusting for individual risk factors, wintertime temperature variance, yearly ozone levels, and long-term trends, to estimate the chronic effects on mortality of long-term exposure to summer temperature SD, and then pooled results across cities. Mortality hazard ratios ranged from 1.028 (95\% confidence interval, 1.013- 1.042) per 1 °C increase in summer temperature SD for persons with congestive heart failure to 1.040 (95\% confidence interval, 1.022-1.059) per 1 °C increase for those with diabetes. Associations were higher in elderly persons and lower in cities with a higher percentage of land with green surface. Our data suggest that long-term increases in temperature variability may increase the risk of mortality in different subgroups of susceptible older populations.},

Due to their high specificity and binding affinity, aptamers directly block or interrupt the functions of target proteins making them promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of human maladies. Additionally, aptamers that bind to cell surface proteins are well suited for the targeted delivery of other therapeutics, such as conjugated small interfering RNAs (siRNA) that induce RNA interference (RNAi). Thus, aptamer-siRNA chimeras may offer dual-functions, in which the aptamer inhibits a receptor function, while the siRNA internalizes into the cell to target a specific mRNA. This review focuses on the current progress and therapeutic potential of RNA aptamers, including the use of cell-internalizing aptamers as cell-type specific delivery vehicles for targeted RNAi. In particular, we discuss emerging aptamer-based therapeutics that provide unique clinical opportunities for the treatment various cancers and neurological diseases.},

abstract = {Exosomes are extracellular vesicles of 50 to 100 nm in diameter, released by many cell types. Exosomes are formed inside the cell in intracellular endosomal compartments and are secreted upon fusion of these compartments with the plasma membrane. Cells also secrete other types of membrane vesicles, for instance, by outward budding from the plasma membrane, and although some of them clearly differ from exosomes by their structural features (larger size), others are possibly more difficult to separate. Here, using Rab27a inhibition to modulate exosome secretion, we show the existence of at least 2 distinct populations of vesicles after purification by classical ultracentrifugation from mouse tumor cell conditioned medium. Rab27a inhibition lead to decreased vesicular secretion of some conventional markers of exosomes (CD63, Tsg101, Alix and Hsc70) but did not affect secretion of others (CD9 and Mfge8). By electron microscopy, CD9 was observed on vesicles of various sizes, ranging from 30 nm to more than 150 nm in diameter. Flotation onto sucrose gradients showed different proportions of CD63, CD9 and Mfge8 not only in fractions of densities classically described for exosomes (around 1.15 g/ml) but also in fractions of densities over 1.20 g/ml, indicating the presence of heterogenous vesicle populations. CD9 and Mfge8 were also found in large vesicles pelleted at low speed and can thus not be considered as specific components of endosome-derived vesicles. We propose that the most commonly used protocols for exosome preparations co-purify vesicles from endosomal and other origins, possibly the plasma membrane. Future work will be required to improve techniques for accurate purification and characterization of the different populations of extracellular vesicles.},

abstract = {Cis and trans sugar edge/sugar edge (SE/SE) binding patterns are essential building units of RNAs. For example, SE/SE interactions form the A-minor motifs, the most important tertiary interaction type in functional RNAs. This study provides an in-depth structure and stability analysis for these two base pair families. Gas-phase-optimized geometries are reported for 12 cis and 7 trans SE/SE base pairs and contrasted to their X-ray counterparts. Interaction energies are computed at the RIMP2 level of theory using the density-functional-theory-optimized geometries. There is a good overall agreement between the optimized and X-ray geometries of the cis SE/SE base pairs. In contrast, only three of the seven trans SE/SE binding patterns could be optimized without a significant distortion of the X-ray geometry. Note, however, that many SE/SE base pairs participate in broader networks of interactions; thus it is not surprising to see some of them to deviate from the X-ray geometry in a complete isolation. Computed interaction energies reveal that all 12 known cis SE/SE binding patterns are very stable. Among the trans SE/SE binding patterns, only the rG/rG, rG/rC, and rA/rG base pairs are sufficiently stable in the crystal geometry. Prediction has been made for some structures not yet detected by crystallography, namely, cis rC/rC, rG/rC, rG/rU, and rU/rU and trans rG/rA base pairs. Interestingly, the new cis SE/SE binding patterns are not necessarily isosteric with the remaining 12 members of this family. The trans rG/rA base pair represents a viable option for base pairing in RNA to be identified by future X-ray studies. In a complete lack of structural information, prediction of other unknown members of the trans SE/SE family was not attempted. Analysis of the interaction energies shows a very large electron correlation component of the interaction energy, pointing at the elevated role of dispersion energy as compared to other types of base pairs. This likely is profitable for stabilization of SE/SE binding patterns in polar environments and could be one of the reasons why the A-minor motif is the leading type of tertiary interactions in RNAs.},

abstract = {The elongation stage of protein synthesis consists of repeated cycles of the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA, peptide bond formation, and translocation. The process is normally catalyzed by the elongation factors Tu and G; however, the reactions can proceed, at least in prescribed and limited circumstance, in the absence of the elongation factors, a finding that strongly implies that the chemistry of protein synthesis is inherent in the ribosome. The sarcin/ricin domain in 23 S rRNA, the site of inactivation of ribosomes by ribotoxins, is where the elongation factors bind. The question that arises is whether the sarcin/ricin domain is necessary for factor-independent peptide synthesis. The answer is that it is not. The disruption of the sarcin/ricin domain by covalent modification with either sarcin or pokeweed antiviral protein did not affect factor-independent peptide synthesis; nor did lethal mutations of nucleotides that abolish the binding of elongation factors. The results imply that the sole function of the sarcin/ricin domain is to provide a binding site for the elongation factors and, hence, to facilitate the elongation reactions. The results also raise the possibility of the co-evolution of the sarcin/ricin domain and the elongation factors.},

Bacterial recovery was approximately 20-fold higher at 4 degrees C and 15 degrees C than at 22 degrees C, and obligately psychrophilic bacteria were identified and isolated. Several of the rDNA molecules amplified from isolates and directly from cryoconite DNA preparations had sequences similar to rDNA molecules of species present in adjacent lake ice and microbial mat environments. This cryoconite hole community was therefore most likely seeded by particulates from these local environments. Cryoconite holes may serve as biological refuges that, on glacial melting, can repopulate the local environments.},

abstract = {Much of biology works by applying prior knowledge ('what is known') to an unknown entity, rather than the application of a set of axioms that will elicit knowledge. In addition, the complex biological data stored in bioinformatics databases often require the addition of knowledge to specify and constrain the values held in that database. One way of capturing knowledge within bioinformatics applications and databases is the use of ontologies. An ontology is the concrete form of a conceptualisation of a community's knowledge of a domain. This paper aims to introduce the reader to the use of ontologies within bioinformatics. A description of the type of knowledge held in an ontology will be given.The paper will be illustrated throughout with examples taken from bioinformatics and molecular biology, and a survey of current biological ontologies will be presented. From this it will be seen that the use to which the ontology is put largely determines the content of the ontology. Finally, the paper will describe the process of building an ontology, introducing the reader to the techniques and methods currently in use and the open research questions in ontology development.},

As part of an on-going phylogenetic comparative characterization of bacterial RNase P, the genes encoding RNase P RNA from the thermophiles Thermotoga maritima, Thermotoga neapolitana, Thermus aquaticus, and a mesophilic relative of the latter, Deinococcus radiodurans, have been cloned and sequenced. RNAs transcribed from these genes in vitro are catalytically active in the absence of other components. Active holoenzymes have been reconstituted from the T.aquaticus and T.maritima RNAs and the protein component of RNase P from Escherichia coli. The RNase P RNAs of T.aquaticus and T.martima, synthesized in vitro, were characterized biochemically and shown to be inherently resistant to thermal disruption. Several features of these RNAs suggest mechanisms contributing to thermostability. The new sequences provide correlations that refine the secondary structure model of bacterial RNase P RNA.},

abstract = {Parallel experimental measurements and theoretical calculations have been used to investigate the energetics of electrostatic interactions in the complex formed between a 22 residue, alpha-helical peptide from the N protein of phage lambda and its cognate 19 nucleotide box B RNA hairpin. Salt-dependent free energies were measured for both peptide folding from coil to helix and peptide binding to RNA, and from these the salt-dependence of binding pre-folded, helical peptide to RNA was determined ( partial differential (DeltaG degrees (dock))/ partial differential log[KCl]=5.98(+/-0.21)kcal/mol). (A folding transition taking place in the RNA hairpin loop was shown to have a negligible dependence on salt concentration.) The non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation was used to calculate the same salt dependence of the binding free energy as 5.87(+/-0.22)kcal/mol, in excellent agreement with the measured value. Close agreement between experimental measurements and calculations was also obtained for two variant peptides in which either a basic or acidic residue was replaced with an uncharged residue, and for an RNA variant with a deletion of a single loop nucleotide. The calculations suggest that the strength of electrostatic interactions between a peptide residue and RNA varies considerably with environment, but that all 12 positive and negative N peptide charges contribute significantly to the electrostatic free energy of RNA binding, even at distances up to 11A from backbone phosphate groups. Calculations also show that the net release of ions that accompanies complex formation originates from rearrangements of both peptide and RNA ion atmospheres, and includes accumulation of ions in some regions of the complex as well as displacement of cations and anions from the ion atmospheres of the RNA and peptide, respectively.},

However, regulators can also achieve specificity by binding directly to RNA polymerase (RNAP) and exploiting the kinetic variation intrinsic to different RNAP-promoter complexes. We report here a previously unknown interaction with Escherichia coli RNAP that defines an additional recognition element in bacterial promoters. The strength of this sequence-specific interaction varies at different promoters and affects the lifetime of the complex with RNAP. Selection of rRNA promoter mutants forming long-lived complexes, kinetic analyses of duplex and bubble templates, dimethylsulfate footprinting, and zero-Angstrom crosslinking demonstrated that sigma subunit region 1.2 directly contacts the nontemplate strand base two positions downstream of the -10 element (within the "discriminator" region). By making a nonoptimal sigma1.2-discriminator interaction, rRNA promoters create the short-lived complex required for specific responses to the RNAP binding factors ppGpp and DksA, ultimately accounting for regulation of ribosome synthesis.},

@article{Abrajano2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) is a master regulator of neuronal gene expression. REST functions as a modular scaffold for dynamic recruitment of epigenetic regulatory factors including its primary cofactor, the corepressor for element-1-silencing transcription factor (CoREST), to genomic loci that contain the repressor element-1 (RE1) binding motif. While REST was initially believed to silence RE1 containing neuronal genes in neural stem cells (NSCs) and non-neuronal cells, emerging evidence shows an increasingly complex cell type- and developmental stage-specific repertoire of REST target genes and functions that include regulation of neuronal lineage maturation and plasticity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation on chip (ChIP-chip) analysis to examine REST and CoREST functions during NSC-mediated specification of cholinergic neurons (CHOLNs), GABAergic neurons (GABANs), glutamatergic neurons (GLUTNs), and medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs). We identified largely distinct but overlapping profiles of REST and CoREST target genes during neuronal subtype specification including a disproportionately high percentage that are exclusive to each neuronal subtype. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings demonstrate that the differential deployment of REST and CoREST is an important regulatory mechanism that mediates neuronal subtype specification by modulating specific gene networks responsible for inducing and maintaining neuronal subtype identity. Our observations also implicate a broad array of factors in the generation of neuronal diversity including but not limited to those that mediate homeostasis, cell cycle dynamics, cell viability, stress responses and epigenetic regulation.},

abstract = {Molecular biology has become heavily dependent on biological knowledge encoded in expert curated biological databases. As the volume of biological literature increases, biocurators need help in keeping up with the literature; (semi-) automated aids for biocuration would seem to be an ideal application for natural language processing and text mining. However, to date, there have been few documented successes for improving biocuration throughput using text mining. Our initial investigations took place for the workshop on 'Text Mining for the BioCuration Workflow' at the third International Biocuration Conference (Berlin, 2009). We interviewed biocurators to obtain workflows from eight biological databases. This initial study revealed high-level commonalities, including (i) selection of documents for curation; (ii) indexing of documents with biologically relevant entities (e.g. genes); and (iii) detailed curation of specific relations (e.g. interactions); however, the detailed workflows also showed many variabilities. Following the workshop, we conducted a survey of biocurators. The survey identified biocurator priorities, including the handling of full text indexed with biological entities and support for the identification and prioritization of documents for curation. It also indicated that two-thirds of the biocuration teams had experimented with text mining and almost half were using text mining at that time. Analysis of our interviews and survey provide a set of requirements for the integration of text mining into the biocuration workflow. These can guide the identification of common needs across curated databases and encourage joint experimentation involving biocurators, text mining developers and the larger biomedical research community.},

abstract = {The extreme cold and aridity of the Antarctic McMurdo Dry Valleys have led to the longstanding belief that metabolic rates of soil microbiota are negligible, and that ecosystem changes take place over millennia. Here we report the first direct experimental evidence that soil microbial communities undergo rapid and lasting changes in response to contemporary environmental conditions. Mummified seals, curious natural artifacts found scattered throughout Dry Valleys, alter their underlying soil environment by stabilizing temperatures, elevating relative humidity and reducing ultraviolet exposure. In a unique, multi-year mummified seal transplantation experiment, we found that endemic Dry Valley microbial communities responded to these changes within 3 years, resulting in a sevenfold increase in CO(2) flux and a significant reduction in biodiversity. These findings challenge prevailing ideas about Antarctic Dry Valley ecosystems and indicate that current and future environmental conditions may strongly influence the ecology of the dominant biota in the Dry Valleys.},

abstract = {BC1 RNA is a dendritic untranslated RNA that has been implicated in local translational control mechanisms in neurons. Prerequisite for a functional role of the RNA in synaptodendritic domains is its targeted delivery along the dendritic extent. We report here that the targeting-competent 5' BC1 domain carries two dendritic targeting codes. One code, specifying somatic export, is located in the medial-basal region of the 5' BC1 stem-loop structure. It is defined by an export-determinant stem-bulge motif. The second code, specifying long-range dendritic delivery, is located in the apical part of the 5' stem-loop domain. This element features a GA kink-turn (KT) motif that is indispensable for distal targeting. It specifically interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2, a trans-acting targeting factor that has previously been implicated in the transport of MBP mRNA in oligodendrocytes and neurons. Our work suggests that a BC1 KT motif encodes distal targeting via the A2 pathway and that architectural RNA elements, such as KT motifs, may function as spatial codes in neural cells.},

@article{Liu2012a,
abstract = {One of the key issues in the theoretical prediction of RNA folding is the prediction of loop structure from the sequence. RNA loop free energies are dependent on the loop sequence content. However, most current models account only for the loop length-dependence. The previously developed "Vfold" model (a coarse-grained RNA folding model) provides an effective method to generate the complete ensemble of coarse-grained RNA loop and junction conformations. However, due to the lack of sequence-dependent scoring parameters, the method is unable to identify the native and near-native structures from the sequence. In this study, using a previously developed iterative method for extracting the knowledge-based potential parameters from the known structures, we derive a set of dinucleotide-based statistical potentials for RNA loops and junctions. A unique advantage of the approach is its ability to go beyond the the (known) native structures by accounting for the full free energy landscape, including all the nonnative folds. The benchmark tests indicate that for given loop/junction sequences, the statistical potentials enable successful predictions for the coarse-grained 3D structures from the complete conformational ensemble generated by the Vfold model. The predicted coarse-grained structures can provide useful initial folds for further detailed structural refinement.},

@article{Ventosa1998,
abstract = {The moderately halophilic heterotrophic aerobic bacteria form a diverse group of microorganisms. The property of halophilism is widespread within the bacterial domain. Bacterial halophiles are abundant in environments such as salt lakes, saline soils, and salted food products. Most species keep their intracellular ionic concentrations at low levels while synthesizing or accumulating organic solutes to provide osmotic equilibrium of the cytoplasm with the surrounding medium. Complex mechanisms of adjustment of the intracellular environments and the properties of the cytoplasmic membrane enable rapid adaptation to changes in the salt concentration of the environment. Approaches to the study of genetic processes have recently been developed for several moderate halophiles, opening the way toward an understanding of haloadaptation at the molecular level. The new information obtained is also expected to contribute to the development of novel biotechnological uses for these organisms.

abstract = {A simplified kinetic model scheme is presented that addresses the main reactions of two recently reported peptide self-replicators. Experimentally observed differences in the autocatalytic efficiency between these two systems-- caused by variations in the peptide sequences--and the possible effect of chiral amplification under heterochiral reaction conditions were evaluated. Our numerical simulations indicated that differences in the catalytic performance are exclusively due to pronounced variations in the rate parameters that control the reversible and hydrophobic interactions in the reaction system but neither to alterations in the underlying reaction network nor to changes in the stoichiometry of the involved aggregation processes. Model predictions further demonstrated the possible existence of chiral amplification if peptide self-replication is performed under heterochiral reaction conditions. Pointing into the direction of a possible cause for biomolecular homochirality, it was found that in open flow reactors, keeping the system under non-equilibrium conditions, a remarkable amplification of enantiomeric excess could be achieved. According to our modeling, this is due to a chiroselective autocatalytic effect and a meso-type separation process both of which are assumed to be intrinsic for the underlying dynamics of heterochiral peptide self-replication.},

The local rule theory provides a framework for understanding the assembly of icosahedral viruses. These include both viruses that fall in the quasiequivalence theory of Caspar and Klug and the polyoma virus structure, which violates quasi-equivalence and has puzzled researchers since it was first observed. Local rules are essentially templates for energetically favorable arrangements. The tolerance margins for these rules are investigated through computer simulations. When these tolerance margins are exceeded in a particular way, the result is a "spiraling" malformation that has been observed in nature.},

Under stringent conditions induced by seryl-tRNA starvation the transcription of the rnpB gene was repressed in wild type E. coli but not in a relaxed strain carrying a relA- mutation. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to examine sequences of the rnpB promoter necessary for stringent control. The results indicate that the discriminator region is responsible for the transcription repression of the rnpB gene during the stringent response and that both the content and position of GC pairs in the region determine the strength of negative stringent signals.},

The results of our phylogenetic analysis corroborate and extend previous findings in showing that the genus Clostridium is extremely heterogeneous, with many species phylogenetically intermixed with other spore-forming and non-spore-forming genera. The genus Clostridium is clearly in need of major revision, and the rRNA structures defined in this and previous studies may provide a sound basis for future taxonomic restructuring. The problems and different possibilities for restructuring are discussed in light of the phenotypic and phylogenetic data, and a possible hierarchical structure for the clostridia and their close relatives is presented. On the basis of phenotypic criteria and the results of phylogenetic analyses the following five new genera and 11 new combinations are proposed: Caloramator gen. nov., with Caloramator fervidus comb. nov.; Filifactor gen. nov., with Filifactor villosus comb. nov.; Moorella gen. nov., with Moorella thermoacetica comb. nov. and Moorella thermoautotrophica comb. nov.; Oxobacter gen. nov., with Oxobacter pfennigii comb. nov.; Oxalophagus gen. nov., with Oxalophagus oxalicus comb. nov.; Eubacterium barkeri comb. nov.; Paenibacillus durum comb. nov.; Thermoanaerobacter kivui comb. nov.; Thermoanaerobacter thermocopriae comb. nov.; and Thermoanerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum comb. nov.},

abstract = {The effects of monovalent cations (Li(+), Na(+), K(+), Rb(+), Cs(+), and NH4(+)) on the thermal stability of RNA tertiary structure were investigated by UV melting. We show that with the RNA used here (nucleotides 1051-1108 of Escherichia coli 23 S rRNA with four base substitutions), monovalent cations and Mg(2+) compete in stabilizing the RNA tertiary structure, and that the competition takes place between two boundaries: one where Mg(2+) concentration is zero and the other where it is maximally stabilizing ("saturating"). The pattern of competition is the same for all monovalent cations and depends on the cation's ability to displace Mg(2+) from the RNA, its ability to stabilize tertiary structure in the absence of Mg(2+), and its ability to stabilize tertiary structure at saturating Mg(2+) concentrations. The stabilizing ability of a monovalent cation depends on its unhydrated ionic radius, and at a low monovalent cation concentration and saturating Mg(2+), there is a (calculated) net release of a single monovalent cation/RNA molecule when tertiary structure is denatured. The implications are that under these conditions there is at least one binding site for monovalent cations on the RNA, the site is specifically associated with formation of stable tertiary structure, K(+) is the most effective of the tested cations, and Mg(2+) appears ineffective at this site. At high ionic strength, and in the absence of Mg(2+), stabilization of tertiary structure is still monovalent-cation specific and ionic-radius dependent, but a larger number of cations ( approximately eight) are released upon RNA tertiary structure denaturation, and NH(4)(+) appears to be the most effective cation in stabilizing tertiary structure under these conditions. In the majority of the experiments, methanol was added as a cosolvent to the buffer. Its use allowed the examination of the behavior of monovalent ions under conditions where their effects would otherwise have been too weak to be observed. Methanol stabilizes tertiary but not secondary structure of the RNA. There was no evidence that it either causes qualitative changes in cation-binding properties of the RNA or a change in the pattern of monovalent cation/Mg(2+) competition.},

The high-light-adapted ecotype has the smallest genome (1,657,990 base pairs, 1,716 genes) of any known oxygenic phototroph, whereas the genome of its low-light-adapted counterpart is significantly larger, at 2,410,873 base pairs (2,275 genes). The comparative architectures of these two strains reveal dynamic genomes that are constantly changing in response to myriad selection pressures. Although the two strains have 1,350 genes in common, a significant number are not shared, and these have been differentially retained from the common ancestor, or acquired through duplication or lateral transfer. Some of these genes have obvious roles in determining the relative fitness of the ecotypes in response to key environmental variables, and hence in regulating their distribution and abundance in the oceans.},

abstract = {Five point mutations in a particular beta-lactamase allele jointly increase bacterial resistance to a clinically important antibiotic by a factor of approximately 100,000. In principle, evolution to this high-resistance beta-lactamase might follow any of the 120 mutational trajectories linking these alleles. However, we demonstrate that 102 trajectories are inaccessible to Darwinian selection and that many of the remaining trajectories have negligible probabilities of realization, because four of these five mutations fail to increase drug resistance in some combinations. Pervasive biophysical pleiotropy within the beta-lactamase seems to be responsible, and because such pleiotropy appears to be a general property of missense mutations, we conclude that much protein evolution will be similarly constrained. This implies that the protein tape of life may be largely reproducible and even predictable.},

Virtually every molecule made in every cell was made either directly by the ribosome or by enzymes made by the ribosome. Although the ribosome was discovered half a century ago, progress in the field of translation has been revolutionized by the atomic structures of the ribosomal subunits determined in 2000. These structures paved the way not only for more sophisticated biochemical and genetic experiments, but also for the phasing and/or molecular interpretation of all subsequent structures of the ribosome by crystallography or cryoEM (cryo-electron microscopy).

abstract = {Ribosome-driven protein biosynthesis is comprised of four phases: initiation, elongation, termination and recycling. In bacteria, ribosome recycling requires ribosome recycling factor and elongation factor G, and several structures of bacterial recycling complexes have been determined. In the eukaryotic and archaeal kingdoms, however, recycling involves the ABC-type ATPase ABCE1 and little is known about its structural basis. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of eukaryotic and archaeal ribosome recycling complexes containing ABCE1 and the termination factor paralogue Pelota. These structures reveal the overall binding mode of ABCE1 to be similar to canonical translation factors. Moreover, the iron-sulphur cluster domain of ABCE1 interacts with and stabilizes Pelota in a conformation that reaches towards the peptidyl transferase centre, thus explaining how ABCE1 may stimulate peptide-release activity of canonical termination factors. Using the mechanochemical properties of ABCE1, a conserved mechanism in archaea and eukaryotes is suggested that couples translation termination to recycling, and eventually to re-initiation.},

abstract = {Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and their associated genes are linked to a mechanism of acquired resistance against bacteriophages. Bacteria can integrate short stretches of phage-derived sequences (spacers) within CRISPR loci to become phage resistant. In this study, we further characterized the efficiency of CRISPR1 as a phage resistance mechanism in Streptococcus thermophilus. First, we show that CRISPR1 is distinct from previously known phage defense systems and is effective against the two main groups of S. thermophilus phages. Analyses of 30 bacteriophage-insensitive mutants of S. thermophilus indicate that the addition of one new spacer in CRISPR1 is the most frequent outcome of a phage challenge and that the iterative addition of spacers increases the overall phage resistance of the host. The added new spacers have a size of between 29 to 31 nucleotides, with 30 being by far the most frequent. Comparative analysis of 39 newly acquired spacers with the complete genomic sequences of the wild-type phages 2972, 858, and DT1 demonstrated that the newly added spacer must be identical to a region (named proto-spacer) in the phage genome to confer a phage resistance phenotype. Moreover, we found a CRISPR1-specific sequence (NNAGAAW) located downstream of the proto-spacer region that is important for the phage resistance phenotype. Finally, we show through the analyses of 20 mutant phages that virulent phages are rapidly evolving through single nucleotide mutations as well as deletions, in response to CRISPR1.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Specific information on newly-discovered proteins is often difficult to find in literature. Particularly if only sequences and no common names of proteins or genes are available, preceding sequence similarity searches can be crucial for the process of information collection. In drug research it is important to know whether a small molecule targets only one specific protein or whether similar or homologous proteins are also influenced which may account for possible side effects. RESULTS: prolific (protein-literature investigation for interacting compounds) provides a one-step solution to investigate available information on given protein names, sequences, similar proteins or sequences on the gene level. Co-occurrences of UniProtKB/Swiss- Prot proteins and PubChem compounds in all PubMed abstracts are retrievable. Concise "heat-maps" and tables display frequencies of co-occurrences. They provide links to processed literature with highlighted found protein and compound synonyms. Evaluation with manually curated drug-protein relationships showed that up to 69\% could be discovered by automatic text-processing.

abstract = {RNA degradation is among the most fundamental processes that occur in living cells. The continuous decay of RNA molecules is associated not only with nucleotide turnover, but also with transcript maturation and quality control. The efficiency of RNA decay is ensured by a broad spectrum of both specific and non-specific ribonucleases. Some of these ribonucleases participate mainly in processing primary transcripts and in RNA quality control. Others preferentially digest mature, functional RNAs to yield a variety of molecules that together constitute the RNA degradome. Recently, it has become increasingly clear that the composition of the cellular RNA degradome can be modulated by numerous endogenous and exogenous factors (e.g. by stress). In addition, instead of being hydrolyzed to single nucleotides, some intermediates of RNA degradation can accumulate and function as signalling molecules or participate in mechanisms that control gene expression. Thus, RNA degradation appears to be not only a process that contributes to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis but also an underestimated source of regulatory molecules.},

abstract = {Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as an important class of RNAs playing key roles in development, disease and epigenetics. Knowledge of lncRNA structure may be critical in understanding function for many lncRNA systems. Due to the enormous number of possible folds for these sequences, secondary structure determination presents a significant challenge, both experimentally and computationally. Here, we present a new strategy capable of determining the RNA secondary structure in the wet lab without significant reliance on computational predictions. First, we chemically probe the entire lncRNA. Next, using a shotgun approach, we divide the RNA into overlapping fragments and probe these fragments. We then compare probing profiles of fragments with the profiles of the full RNA and identify similarities. Sequence regions with profiles that are similar in the fragment and full-length transcript possess only base pairing partners within the fragment. Thus, by experimentally folding smaller and smaller fragments of the full RNA and probing these chemically, we are able to isolate modular sub-domains, dramatically reducing the number of possible folds. The method also eliminates the possibility of pseudoknots within a modular sub-domain. The 3S technique is ideally suited for lncRNAs because it is designed for long RNA sequences. The 3S-determined secondary structure of a specific lncRNA in one species (e.g., human) enables searches for instances of the same lncRNA in other species.},

Biochemical analysis of ribosomal initiation complexes at CUG versus AUG initiation codons revealed that cells use an elongator leucine-bound transfer RNA (Leu-tRNA) to initiate translation at cryptic CUG start codons. CUG/Leu-tRNA initiation was independent of the canonical initiator tRNA (AUG/Met-tRNA(i)(Met)) pathway but required expression of eukaryotic initiation factor 2A.

abstract = {A fast-growing and cell-fusing hyperthermophilic archaeon was isolated from a hydrothermal vent at Suiyo Seamount, Izu-Bonin Arc, Western Pacific Ocean. Strain TS2(T) is an irregular, motile coccus that is generally 0.7-1.5 microm in diameter and possesses a polar tuft of flagella. In the mid-exponential phase of growth, cells that appeared black under phase-contrast microscopy fused at room temperature in the presence of a DNA-intercalating dye, as previously observed in Thermococcus coalescens. Cell fusion was not observed in later growth phases. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the cells in the mid-exponential phase had a 5 nm-thick, electron-dense cell envelope that appeared to associate loosely with the cytoplasmic membrane. As the growth stage progressed, a surface layer developed on the membrane under the envelope and the envelope eventually peeled off. These observations suggest that the surface layer prevents the fusion of cells. Cells of strain TS2(T) grew at 50-85 degrees C, pH 5.6-8.3 and at NaCl concentrations of 1.0 to 4.5 \%, with optimal growth occurring at 80 degrees C, pH 7.0 and 3.0 \% NaCl. Under optimal growth conditions, strain TS2(T) grew very fast with an apparent doubling time of 20 min. It is suggested that the biosynthesis of the surface layer cannot catch up with cell multiplication in the mid-exponential phase and thus cells without the surface layer are generated. Strain TS2(T) was an anaerobic chemo-organotroph that grew on either yeast extract or tryptone as the sole growth substrate. The genomic DNA G+C content was 54.6 mol\%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that the isolate belongs to the genus Thermococcus. However, no significant DNA-DNA hybridization was observed between the genomic DNA of strain TS2(T) and phylogenetically related Thermococcus species. On the basis of this evidence, strain TS2(T) is proposed to represent a novel species, Thermococcus celericrescens sp. nov., a name chosen to reflect the fast growth of the strain. The type strain is TS2(T) (=NBRC 101555(T)=JCM 13640(T)=DSM 17994(T)).},

abstract = {We reanalyze the pressure dependence of viscosity of liquids of constant composition under isothermal conditions. Based exclusively on very general considerations concerning the relationship between viscosity and "free volume," we show that, at moderate values of pressure, viscosity increases, as a rule, with increasing pressure, provided the liquid is in stable or metastable (undercooled) equilibrium states. However, even if the behavior of the viscosity is governed by free volume effects, deviations from a positive pressure dependence are possible, when the liquid's thermal expansion coefficient is negative. We derive an equation that allows one to quantitatively determine the pressure dependence of viscosity, which requires, in the simplest case, only the knowledge of the temperature dependence of viscosity at constant pressure, the thermal expansion coefficient, and the isothermal compressibility of the liquid. As an example, the negative pressure dependence of water in the range of temperatures 0-4 degrees C and of several silicate liquids, such as albite, jadeite, dacite, basalts, etc., could be explained in such a way. Other glass-forming liquids initially (for moderate pressures) show a positive pressure dependence of viscosity that changes to a negative one when subjected to high (approximately GPa) isostatic pressure. A detailed analysis of water and already mentioned silicate melts at GPa pressures shows that, in addition to free volume effects, other pressure induced structural transformations may have to be accounted for in a variety of cases. By this reason, the theoretical analysis is extended (i) in order to describe the pressure dependence of viscosity for systems that are in frozen-in thermodynamic nonequilibrium states (glasses, i.e., undercooled liquids below the glass transition temperature Tg) and (ii) to systems which undergo, in addition to variations of the free volume, pressure induced changes of other structural parameters. In such cases a decrease of viscosity with increasing pressure may occur, in principle, even if the thermal expansion coefficient is positive. In this way, the present analysis grants a general tool to estimate the pressure dependence of viscosity and supposedly settles the controversy in the current literature.},

abstract = {The models of nucleotide substitution used by most maximum likelihood-based methods assume that the evolutionary process is stationary, reversible, and homogeneous. We present an extension of the Barry and Hartigan model, which can be used to estimate parameters by maximum likelihood (ML) when the data contain invariant sites and there are violations of the assumptions of stationarity, reversibility, and homogeneity. Unlike most ML methods for estimating invariant sites, we estimate the nucleotide composition of invariant sites separately from that of variable sites. We analyze a bacterial data set where problems due to lack of stationarity and homogeneity have been previously well noted and use the parametric bootstrap to show that the data are consistent with our general Markov model. We also show that estimates of invariant sites obtained using our method are fairly accurate when applied to data simulated under the general Markov model.},

abstract = {Structured RNA molecules form complex 3D architectures stabilized by multiple interactions involving the nucleotide base, sugar and phosphate moieties. A significant percentage of the bases in structured RNA molecules in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) hydrogen-bond with phosphates of other nucleotides. By extracting and superimposing base-phosphate (BPh) interactions from a reduced-redundancy subset of 3D structures from the PDB, we identified recurrent phosphate-binding sites on the RNA bases. Quantum chemical calculations were carried out on model systems representing each BPh interaction. The calculations show that the centers of each cluster obtained from the structure superpositions correspond to energy minima on the potential energy hypersurface. The calculations also show that the most stable phosphate-binding sites occur on the Watson-Crick edge of guanine and the Hoogsteen edge of cytosine. We modified the 'Find RNA 3D' (FR3D) software suite to automatically find and classify BPh interactions. Comparison of the 3D structures of the 16S and 23S rRNAs of Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus revealed that most BPh interactions are phylogenetically conserved and they occur primarily in hairpin, internal or junction loops or as part of tertiary interactions. Bases that form BPh interactions, which are conserved in the rRNA 3D structures are also conserved in homologous rRNA sequence alignments.},

abstract = {The xenotropic/polytropic subgroup of mouse leukemia viruses (MLVs) all rely on the XPR1 receptor for entry, but these viruses vary in tropism, distribution among wild and laboratory mice, pathogenicity, strategies used for transmission, and sensitivity to host restriction factors. Most, but not all, isolates have typical xenotropic or polytropic host range, and these two MLV tropism types have now been detected in humans as viral sequences or as infectious virus, termed XMRV, or xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus. The mouse xenotropic MLVs (X-MLVs) were originally defined by their inability to infect cells of their natural mouse hosts. It is now clear, however, that X-MLVs actually have the broadest host range of the MLVs. Nearly all nonrodent mammals are susceptible to X-MLVs, and all species of wild mice and several common strains of laboratory mice are X-MLV susceptible. The polytropic MLVs, named for their apparent broad host range, show a more limited host range than the X-MLVs in that they fail to infect cells of many mouse species as well as many nonrodent mammals. The co-evolution of these viruses with their receptor and other host factors that affect their replication has produced a heterogeneous group of viruses capable of inducing various diseases, as well as endogenized viral genomes, some of which have been domesticated by their hosts to serve in antiviral defense.},

abstract = {Correspondence analysis is an explorative computational method for the study of associations between variables. Much like principal component analysis, it displays a low-dimensional projection of the data, e.g., into a plane. It does this, though, for two variables simultaneously, thus revealing associations between them. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of correspondence analysis to and high value for the analysis of microarray data, displaying associations between genes and experiments. To introduce the method, we show its application to the well-known Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-cycle synchronization data by Spellman et al. [Spellman, P. T., Sherlock, G., Zhang, M. Q., Iyer, V. R., Anders, K., Eisen, M. B., Brown, P. O., Botstein, D. \& Futcher, B. (1998) Mol. Biol. Cell 9, 3273-3297], allowing for comparison with their visualization of this data set. Furthermore, we apply correspondence analysis to a non-time-series data set of our own, thus supporting its general applicability to microarray data of different complexity, underlying structure, and experimental strategy (both two-channel fluorescence-tag and radioactive labeling).},

MK-7 was the predominant respiratory quinone. Zeaxanthin was the major carotenoid pigment produced; flexirubin-type pigments were not produced. TDMA-5(T) was sensitive to gamma-irradiation. The strain degraded gelatin, casein, starch, Tween 80 and DNA. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence placed TDMA-5(T) in a distinct lineage in the family Sphingobacteriaceae, sharing 89.4-93.4 \% sequence similarity with members of the nearest genus Pedobacter. Strain TDMA-5(T) could be distinguished from the other members of the family Sphingobacteriaceae by a number of chemotaxonomic and phenotypic characteristics. Based on its unique phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic features, strain TDMA-5(T) represents a novel genus and species, for which the name Nubsella zeaxanthinifaciens gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Nubsella zeaxanthinifaciens is TDMA-5(T) (=NBRC 102579(T) =CCUG 54348(T)).},

abstract = {We have used laboratory evolution methods to enhance the thermostability and activity of the psychrophilic protease subtilisin S41, with the goal of investigating the mechanisms by which this enzyme can adapt to different selection pressures. A combined strategy of random mutagenesis, saturation mutagenesis and in vitro recombination (DNA shuffling) was used to generate mutant libraries, which were screened to identify enzymes that acquired greater thermostability without sacrificing low-temperature activity. The half-life of seven-amino acid substitution variant 3-2G7 at 60 degrees C is approximately 500 times that of wild-type and far surpasses those of homologous mesophilic subtilisins. The dependence of half-life on calcium concentration indicates that enhanced calcium binding is largely responsible for the increased stability. The temperature optimum of the activity of 3-2G7 is shifted upward by approximately 10 degrees C. Unlike natural thermophilic enzymes, however, the activity of 3-2G7 at low temperatures was not compromised. The catalytic efficiency, k(cat)/K(M), was enhanced approximately threefold over a wide temperature range (10 to 60 degrees C). The activation energy for catalysis, determined by the temperature dependence of k(cat)/K(M) in the range 15 to 35 degrees C, is nearly identical to wild-type and close to half that of its highly similar mesophilic homolog, subtilisin SSII, indicating that the evolved S41 enzyme retained its psychrophilic character in spite of its dramatically increased thermostability. These results demonstrate that it is possible to increase activity at low temperatures and stability at high temperatures simultaneously. The fact that enzymes displaying both properties are not found in nature most likely reflects the effects of evolution, rather than any intrinsic physical-chemical limitations on proteins.},

A polyphasic approach was used to characterize the taxonomic position of the novel strains. Both strains were Gram-negative, aerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the novel isolates belong to the genus Chitinophaga but are clearly separated from the recognized species of this genus; gene sequence similarities between the novel isolates and type strains of recognized species ranged from 91.2 to 96.5 \%. One exception was found; strain Gsoil 052(T) and the type strain of Chitinophaga filiformis had a gene sequence similarity of 99.6 \% but had a DNA-DNA relatedness value of 38 \%. Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data (major menaquinone, MK-7; major fatty acids, iso-C(15 : 0) and C(16 : 1)omega5c; major hydroxy fatty acid, iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH and major polyamine, homospermidine) supported the affiliation of both strains Gsoil 040(T) and Gsoil 052(T) to the genus Chitinophaga. The results of physiological and biochemical tests enabled the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of the novel strains from the other recognized species of the genus Chitinophaga. Therefore, it is suggested that the new isolates represent two novel species, for which the names Chitinophaga ginsengisoli [corrected] sp. nov.

Antimicrobial activity tests of L23 and L60 were performed by a diffusion method with 207 bacterial strains, isolated from female patients presenting a urogenital infection. Inhibitory substances interaction tests were carried out by using a streak-diffusion method on agar plates. One hundred percent of the clinical isolates showed sensitivity to the antimicrobial substances produced by L23 and L60. The selected lactobacilli produced larger inhibition halos when compared to several antibiotics commonly used for treating these infections. Synergistic interactions and indifferent interactions were recorded in 68.6\% and 31.4\% of the cases, respectively. No antagonistic interactions were observed. In conclusion, the bacteriocin-producing strains L23 and L60 are potential candidates for probiotic prophylaxis and treatment of urogenital disorders in women.},

abstract = {Reef-building corals are comprised of close associations between the coral animal, symbiotic zooxanthellae, and a diversity of associated microbes (including Bacteria, Archaea and Fungi). Together, these comprise the coral holobiont - a paradigm that emphasizes the potential contributions of each component to the overall function and health of the coral. Little is known about the ecology of the coral-associated microbial community and its hypothesized role in coral health. We explored bacteria-bacteria antagonism among 67 bacterial isolates from the scleractinian coral Montastrea annularis at two temperatures using Burkholder agar diffusion assays. A majority of isolates exhibited inhibitory activity (69.6\% of isolates at 25 degrees C, 52.2\% at 31 degrees C), with members of the gamma-proteobacteria (Vibrionales and Alteromonadales) being especially antagonistic. Elevated temperatures generally reduced levels of antagonism, although the effects were complex. Several potential pathogens were observed in the microbial community of apparently healthy corals, and 11.6\% of isolates were able to inhibit the growth of the coral pathogen Vibrio shiloi at 25 degrees C. Overall, this study demonstrates that antagonism could be a structuring force in coral-associated microbial communities and may contribute to pathogenesis as well as disease resistance.},

abstract = {Three-way junction RNAs adopt a recurrent Y shape when two of the helices form a coaxial stack and the third helix establishes one or more tertiary contacts several base pairs away from the junction. In this review, the structure, distribution, and functional relevance of these motifs are examined. Structurally, the folds exhibit conserved junction topologies, and the distal tertiary interactions play a crucial role in determining the final shape of the structures. The junctions and remote tertiary contacts behave as flexible hinge motifs that respond to changes in the other region, providing these folds with switching mechanisms that have been shown to be functionally useful in a variety of contexts. In addition, the juxtaposition of RNA domains at the junction and at the distal tertiary complexes enables the RNA helices to adopt unusual conformations that are frequently used by proteins, RNA molecules, and antibiotics as platforms for specific binding. As a consequence of these properties, Y-shaped junctions are widely distributed in all kingdoms of life, having been observed in small naked RNAs such as riboswitches and ribozymes or embedded in complex ribonucleoprotein systems like ribosomal RNAs, RNase P, or the signal recognition particle. In all cases, the folds were found to play an essential role for the functioning or assembly of the RNA or ribonucleoprotein systems that contain them.},

abstract = {Multiple sequence alignments are powerful tools for understanding the structures, functions, and evolutionary histories of linear biological macromolecules (DNA, RNA, and proteins), and for finding homologs in sequence databases. We address several ontological issues related to RNA sequence alignments that are informed by structure. Multiple sequence alignments are usually shown as two-dimensional (2D) matrices, with rows representing individual sequences, and columns identifying nucleotides from different sequences that correspond structurally, functionally, and/or evolutionarily. However, the requirement that sequences and structures correspond nucleotide-by-nucleotide is unrealistic and hinders representation of important biological relationships. High-throughput sequencing efforts are also rapidly making 2D alignments unmanageable because of vertical and horizontal expansion as more sequences are added. Solving the shortcomings of traditional RNA sequence alignments requires explicit annotation of the meaning of each relationship within the alignment. We introduce the notion of "correspondence," which is an equivalence relation between RNA elements in sets of sequences as the basis of an RNA alignment ontology. The purpose of this ontology is twofold: first, to enable the development of new representations of RNA data and of software tools that resolve the expansion problems with current RNA sequence alignments, and second, to facilitate the integration of sequence data with secondary and three-dimensional structural information, as well as other experimental information, to create simultaneously more accurate and more exploitable RNA alignments.},

abstract = {The diversity and distribution of a bacterial community from Coffee Pots Hot Spring, a thermal spring in Yellowstone National Park with a temperature range of 39.3 to 74.1 degrees C and pH range of 5.75 to 6.91, were investigated by sequencing cloned PCR products and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of 16S rRNA and metabolic genes. The spring was inhabited by three Aquificae genera--Thermocrinis, Hydrogenobaculum, and Sulfurihydrogenibium--and members of the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, and candidate division OP5. The in situ chemical affinities were calculated for 41 potential metabolic reactions using measured environmental parameters and a range of hydrogen and oxygen concentrations. Reactions that use oxygen, ferric iron, sulfur, and nitrate as electron acceptors were predicted to be the most energetically favorable, while reactions using sulfate were expected to be less favorable. Samples were screened for genes used in ammonia oxidation (amoA, bacterial gene only), the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle (aclB), the Calvin cycle (cbbM), sulfate reduction (dsrAB), nitrogen fixation (nifH), nitrite reduction (nirK), and sulfide oxidation (soxEF1) by PCR. Genes for carbon fixation by the rTCA cycle and nitrogen fixation were detected. All aclB sequences were phylogenetically related and spatially correlated to Sulfurihydrogenibium 16S rRNA gene sequences using qPCR (R(2) = 0.99). This result supports the recent finding of citrate cleavage by enzymes other than ATP citrate lyase in the rTCA cycle of the Aquificaceae family. We briefly consider potential biochemical mechanisms that may allow Sulfurihydrogenibium and Thermocrinis to codominate some hydrothermal environments.},

To practice the selection, a sequence of 30 nucleotides was located close to the putative reaction site in a derivative of a naturally occurring self-folding RNA whose crystal structure is known. RNAs whose activity depended on the starting three-dimensional structure were selected with 3'-5' ligation specificity, indicating that the strategy can be used to acquire a variety of catalytic sites and other functional RNA modules.},

@article{Leontis2002,
abstract = {The traditional way to infer RNA secondary structure involves an iterative process of alignment and evaluation of covariation statistics between all positions possibly involved in basepairing. Watson-Crick basepairs typically show covariations that score well when examples of two or more possible basepairs occur. This is not necessarily the case for non-Watson-Crick basepairing geometries. For example, for sheared (trans Hoogsteen/Sugar edge) pairs, one base is highly conserved (always A or mostly A with some C or U), while the other can vary (G or A and sometimes C and U as well). RNA motifs consist of ordered, stacked arrays of non-Watson-Crick basepairs that in the secondary structure representation form hairpin or internal loops, multi-stem junctions, and even pseudoknots. Although RNA motifs occur recurrently and contribute in a modular fashion to RNA architecture, it is usually not apparent which bases interact and whether it is by edge-to-edge H-bonding or solely by stacking interactions. Using a modular sequence-analysis approach, recurrent motifs related to the sarcin-ricin loop of 23S RNA and to loop E from 5S RNA were predicted in universally conserved regions of the large ribosomal RNAs (16S- and 23S-like) before the publication of high-resolution, atomic-level structures of representative examples of 16S and 23S rRNA molecules in their native contexts. This provides the opportunity to evaluate the predictive power of motif-level sequence analysis, with the goal of automating the process for predicting RNA motifs in genomic sequences. The process of inferring structure from sequence by constructing accurate alignments is a circular one. The crucial link that allows a productive iteration of motif modeling and realignment is the comparison of the sequence variations for each putative pair with the corresponding isostericity matrix to determine which basepairs are consistent both with the sequence and the geometrical data.},

abstract = {Kink-turn (K-turn) motifs are asymmetric internal loops found at conserved positions in diverse RNAs, with sharp bends in phosphodiester backbones producing V-shaped structures. Explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for three K-turns from 23S rRNA, i.e., Kt-38 located at the base of the A-site finger, Kt-42 located at the base of the L7/L12 stalk, and Kt-58 located in domain III, and for the K-turn of human U4 snRNA. The simulations reveal hinge-like K-turn motions on the nanosecond timescale. The first conserved A-minor interaction between the K-turn stems is entirely stable in all simulations. The angle between the helical arms of Kt-38 and Kt-42 is regulated by local variations of the second A-minor (type I) interaction between the stems. Its variability ranges from closed geometries to open ones stabilized by insertion of long-residency waters between adenine and cytosine. The simulated A-minor geometries fully agree with x-ray data. Kt-58 and Kt-U4 exhibit similar elbow-like motions caused by conformational change of the adenosine from the nominally unpaired region. Despite the observed substantial dynamics of K-turns, key tertiary interactions are stable and no sign of unfolding is seen. We suggest that some K-turns are flexible elements mediating large-scale ribosomal motions during the protein synthesis cycle.},

abstract = {Novel strains of obligately chemolithoautotrophic, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria have been isolated from various depths of Lake Fryxell, Antarctica. Physiological, morphological, and phylogenetic analyses showed these strains to be related to mesophilic Thiobacillus species, such as T. thioparus. However, the psychrotolerant Antarctic isolates showed an adaptation to cold temperatures and thus should be active in the nearly freezing waters of the lake. Enumeration by most-probable-number analysis in an oxic, thiosulfate-containing medium revealed that the sulfur-oxidizing chemolithotroph population peaks precisely at the oxycline (9.5 m), although viable cells exist well into the anoxic, sulfidic waters of the lake. The sulfur-oxidizing bacteria described here likely play a key role in the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and sulfur in Lake Fryxell.},

abstract = {RNA aptamers can fold into complex structures and bind with high affinity and selectivity to various macromolecules, viruses, and cells. They are isolated from a large pool of nucleic acids by a conceptually straightforward iterative selection process called SELEX. Aptamers have enormous potential as therapeutics due to their ability to bind to proteins and specifically inhibit their functions with minimal or no harmful side-effects. The first aptamer therapeutic was FDA approved in 2005 and a number of novel aptamer-based therapeutics are currently undergoing clinical trials for treating diseases such as macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularization, intravascular thrombus, acute coronary syndrome, von Willebrand factor related disorders, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), angiomas, acute myeloid leukemia, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and several others. In this review, we present aptamers in on-going, completed, and terminated clinical studies highlighting their mechanism of action as well as the inherent challenges of aptamer production and use.},

Although the synthesis of artificial protein cages is a rapidly developing area of materials science, the design criteria for self-assembled shells that can reproduce the remarkable properties of viral capsids are only beginning to be understood. We present here a minimal model for equilibrium capsid structure, introducing an explicit interaction between protein multimers (capsomers). Using Monte Carlo simulation we show that the model reproduces the main structures of viruses in vivo (T-number icosahedra) and important nonicosahedral structures (with octahedral and cubic symmetry) observed in vitro. Our model can also predict capsid strength and shed light on genome release mechanisms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cold adapted or psychrophilic organisms grow at low temperatures, where most of other organisms cannot grow. This adaptation requires a vast array of sequence, structural and physiological adjustments. To understand the molecular basis of cold adaptation of proteins, we analyzed proteomes of psychrophilic and mesophilic bacterial species and compared the differences in amino acid composition and substitution patterns to investigate their likely association with growth temperatures. RESULTS: In psychrophilic bacteria, serine, aspartic acid, threonine and alanine are overrepresented in the coil regions of secondary structures, whilst glutamic acid and leucine are underrepresented in the helical regions. Compared to mesophiles, psychrophiles comprise a significantly higher proportion of amino acids that contribute to higher protein flexibility in the coil regions of proteins, such as those with tiny/small or neutral side chains. Amino acids with aliphatic, basic, aromatic and hydrophilic side chains are underrepresented in the helical regions of proteins of psychrophiles. The patterns of amino acid substitutions between the orthologous proteins of psychrophiles versus mesophiles are significantly different for several amino acids when compared to their substitutions in orthologous proteins of within the mesophiles or psychrophiles. CONCLUSION: Current results provide quantitative substitution preferences (or avoidance) of amino acids that lead to the adaptation of proteins to cold temperatures. These finding would help future efforts in selecting mutations for rational design of proteins with enhanced psychrophilic properties.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of pseudoknotted nucleic acid secondary structure is an important computational challenge. Prediction algorithms based on dynamic programming aim to find a structure with minimum free energy according to some thermodynamic ("sum of loop energies") model that is implicit in the recurrences of the algorithm. However, a clear definition of what exactly are the loops in pseudoknotted structures, and their associated energies, has been lacking. In this work, we present a complete classification of loops in pseudoknotted nucleic secondary structures, and describe the Rivas and Eddy and other energy models as sum-of-loops energy models. We give a linear time algorithm for parsing a pseudoknotted secondary structure into its component loops. We give two applications of our parsing algorithm. The first is a linear time algorithm to calculate the free energy of a pseudoknotted secondary structure. This is useful for heuristic prediction algorithms, which are widely used since (pseudoknotted) RNA secondary structure prediction is NP-hard. The second application is a linear time algorithm to test the generality of the dynamic programming algorithm of Akutsu for secondary structure prediction. Together with previous work, we use this algorithm to compare the generality of state-of-the-art algorithms on real biological structures.},

abstract = {Recent advances in RNA structure determination include using data from high-throughput probing experiments to improve thermodynamic prediction accuracy. We evaluate the extent and nature of improvements in data-directed predictions for a diverse set of 16S/18S ribosomal sequences using a stochastic model of experimental SHAPE data. The average accuracy for 1000 data-directed predictions always improves over the original minimum free energy (MFE) structure. However, the amount of improvement varies with the sequence, exhibiting a correlation with MFE accuracy. Further analysis of this correlation shows that accurate MFE base pairs are typically preserved in a data-directed prediction, whereas inaccurate ones are not. Thus, the positive predictive value of common base pairs is consistently higher than the directed prediction accuracy. Finally, we confirm sequence dependencies in the directability of thermodynamic predictions and investigate the potential for greater accuracy improvements in the worst performing test sequence.},

A number of chemotaxonomic characteristics supported affiliation of strain CL-AP4(T) with the genus Maribacter, i.e. iso-C(15 : 0) (17.2 \%), iso-C(15 : 1) (16.8 \%) and iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH (14.9 \%) were the dominant fatty acids, MK-6 was the major menaquinone and the DNA G+C content was 37.1 mol\%. DNA-DNA relatedness between CL-AP4(T) and M. arcticus KOPRI 20941(T) was only 10 \%, suggesting that they are genomically distinct species. In addition, strain CL-AP4(T) differed phenotypically from M. arcticus in its optimum growth temperature, its ability to hydrolyse starch, Tween 40 and Tween 80, and production of certain enzymes. On the basis of the results of the polyphasic analysis, strain CL-AP4(T) was classified in the genus Maribacter as belonging to a novel species, for which the name Maribacter antarcticus sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is CL-AP4(T) (=KCCM 90069(T)=JCM 15445(T)).},

Given the potential usefulness of such a system, we have developed one for mammalian 18S rRNA. We inserted a sequence tag into expansion segment 3 of mouse 18S rRNA to monitor expression and cleavage by hybridization. Mutations were identified that confer resistance to pactamycin, allowing functional analysis of 40S ribosomal subunits containing synthetic 18S rRNAs by selectively blocking translation from endogenous (pactamycin-sensitive) subunits. rRNA constructs were suitably expressed in transfected cells, shown to process correctly, incorporate into ≈ 15\% of 40S subunits, and function normally based on various criteria. After rigorous analysis, the system was used to investigate the importance of sequences that flank 18S rRNA in precursor transcripts. Although deletion analysis supported the requirement of binding sites for the U3 snoRNA, it showed that a large segment of the 5' external transcribed spacer and the entire first internal transcribed spacer, both of which flank 18S rRNA, are not required. The success of this approach opens the possibility of functional analyses of ribosomes, with applications in basic research and synthetic biology.},

abstract = {Due to recent algorithmic progress, tools for the gold standard of comparative RNA analysis, namely Sankoff-style simultaneous alignment and folding, are now readily applicable. Such approaches, however, compare RNAs with respect to a simultaneously predicted, single, nested consensus structure. To make multiple alignment of RNAs available in cases, where this limitation of the standard approach is critical, we introduce a web server that provides a complete and convenient interface to the RNA structure alignment tool 'CARNA'. This tool uniquely supports RNAs with multiple conserved structures per RNA and aligns pseudoknots intrinsically; these features are highly desirable for aligning riboswitches, RNAs with conserved folding pathways, or pseudoknots. We represent structural input and output information as base pair probability dot plots; this provides large flexibility in the input, ranging from fixed structures to structure ensembles, and enables immediate visual analysis of the results. In contrast to conventional Sankoff-style approaches, 'CARNA' optimizes all structural similarities in the input simultaneously, for example across an entire RNA structure ensemble. Even compared with already costly Sankoff-style alignment, 'CARNA' solves an intrinsically much harder problem by applying advanced, constraint-based, algorithmic techniques. Although 'CARNA' is specialized to the alignment of RNAs with several conserved structures, its performance on RNAs in general is on par with state-of-the-art general-purpose RNA alignment tools, as we show in a Bralibase 2.1 benchmark. The web server is freely available at http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/CARNA.},

abstract = {Protein biosynthesis on the ribosome requires repeated cycles of ratcheting, which couples rotation of the two ribosomal subunits with respect to each other, and swiveling of the head domain of the small subunit. However, the molecular basis for how the two ribosomal subunits rearrange contacts with each other during ratcheting while remaining stably associated is not known. Here, we describe x-ray crystal structures of the intact Escherichia coli ribosome, either in the apo-form (3.5 angstrom resolution) or with one (4.0 angstrom resolution) or two (4.0 angstrom resolution) anticodon stem-loop tRNA mimics bound, that reveal intermediate states of intersubunit rotation. In the structures, the interface between the small and large ribosomal subunits rearranges in discrete steps along the ratcheting pathway. Positioning of the head domain of the small subunit is controlled by interactions with the large subunit and with the tRNA bound in the peptidyl-tRNA site. The intermediates observed here provide insight into how tRNAs move into the hybrid state of binding that precedes the final steps of mRNA and tRNA translocation.},

abstract = {We now know how to read the sequences of nucleotide letters that comprise the genome at a rather frightening speed--a several-million-base bacterial genome in several days is not a problem for one of the sequencing centers, and a billion-base eukaryotic genome can be done in less than a year. But reading a text and understanding it are two different things. So how well can we understand the genome sequences? The answer to this question is central to the whole enterprise of genomics, and this is where computational analysis of genomes takes the driver's seat. Here I will try to briefly outline some major goals, problems, challenges and approaches of computational genomics. Such a young field is already quite diverse, and in this short article I will concentrate on several issues that seen to be critical for deciphering biology from genome sequences, rather than mathematical and computer-science aspects that are well covered in several excellent books.},

abstract = {Elongation factor G (EF-G) is a GTPase that catalyzes tRNA and mRNA translocation during the elongation cycle of protein synthesis. The GTP-bound state of the factor on the ribosome has been studied mainly with non-hydrolyzable analogs of GTP, which led to controversial conclusions about the role of GTP hydrolysis in translocation. Here we describe a mutant of EF-G in which the catalytic His91 is replaced with Ala. The mutant EF-G does not hydrolyze GTP, but binds GTP with unchanged affinity, allowing us to study the function of the authentic GTP-bound form of EF-G in translocation. Utilizing fluorescent reporter groups attached to the tRNAs, mRNA, and the ribosome we compile the velocity map of translocation seen from different perspectives. The data suggest that GTP hydrolysis accelerates translocation up to 30-fold and facilitates conformational rearrangements of both 30S subunit (presumably the backward rotation of the 30S head) and EF-G that lead to the dissociation of the factor. Thus, EF-G combines the energy regime characteristic for motor proteins, accelerating movement by a conformational change induced by GTP hydrolysis, with that of a switch GTPase, which upon Pi release switches the conformations of EF-G and the ribosome to low affinity, allowing the dissociation of the factor.

abstract = {The psychrophilic cellulase, Cel5G, from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis is composed of a catalytic module (CM) joined to a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) by an unusually long, extended and flexible linker region (LR) containing three loops closed by three disulfide bridges. To evaluate the possible role of this region in cold adaptation, the LR was sequentially shortened by protein engineering, successively deleting one and two loops of this module, whereas the last disulfide bridge was also suppressed by replacing the last two cysteine residue by two alanine residues. The kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the mutants were compared with those of the full-length enzyme, and also with those of the cold-adapted CM alone and with those of the homologous mesophilic enzyme, Cel5A, from Erwinia chrysanthemi. The thermostability of the mutated enzymes as well as their relative flexibility were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry and fluorescence quenching respectively. The topology of the structure of the shortest mutant was determined by SAXS (small-angle X-ray scattering). The data indicate that the sequential shortening of the LR induces a regular decrease of the specific activity towards macromolecular substrates, reduces the relative flexibility and concomitantly increases the thermostability of the shortened enzymes. This demonstrates that the long LR of the full-length enzyme favours the catalytic efficiency at low and moderate temperatures by rendering the structure not only less compact, but also less stable, and plays a crucial role in the adaptation to cold of this cellulolytic enzyme.},

The field is rapidly gaining importance: it promises drugs targeted to particular subpopulations based on genetic background. The pharmacogenomics literature has expanded rapidly, but is dispersed in many journals. It is challenging, therefore, to identify important associations between drugs and molecular entities--particularly genes and gene variants, and thus these critical connections are often lost. Text mining techniques can allow us to convert the free-style text to a computable, searchable format in which pharmacogenomic concepts (such as genes, drugs, polymorphisms, and diseases) are identified, and important links between these concepts are recorded. Availability of full text articles as input into text mining engines is key, as literature abstracts often do not contain sufficient information to identify these pharmacogenomic associations.},

In this respect, a deeper knowledge of complex three-dimensional RNA structures is essential to understand their new biological functions. A number of bioinformatic tools have been proposed to explore two major structural databases (PDB, NDB) in order to analyze various aspects of RNA tertiary structures. One of these tools is RNA FRABASE 1.0, the first web-accessible database with an engine for automatic search of 3D fragments within PDB-derived RNA structures. This search is based upon the user-defined RNA secondary structure pattern. In this paper, we present and discuss RNA FRABASE 2.0. This second version of the system represents a major extension of this tool in terms of providing new data and a wide spectrum of novel functionalities. An intuitionally operated web server platform enables very fast user-tailored search of three-dimensional RNA fragments, their multi-parameter conformational analysis and visualization.},

abstract = {We developed a theoretical framework to prove the existence and quantify the Waddington landscape as well as chreode-biological paths for development and differentiation. The cells can have states with the higher probability ones giving the different cell types. Different cell types correspond to different basins of attractions of the probability landscape. We study how the cells develop from undifferentiated cells to differentiated cells from landscape perspectives. We quantified the Waddington landscape through construction of underlying probability landscape for cell development. We show the developmental process proceeds as moving from undifferentiated to the differentiated basins of attractions. The barrier height of the basins of attractions correlates with the escape time that determines the stability of cell types. We show that the developmental process can be quantitatively described and uncovered by the biological paths on the quantified Waddington landscape from undifferentiated to the differentiated cells. We found the dynamics of the developmental process is controlled by a combination of the gradient and curl force on the landscape. The biological paths often do not follow the steepest descent path on the landscape. The landscape framework also quantifies the possibility of reverse differentiation process such as cell reprogramming from differentiated cells back to the original stem cell. We show that the biological path of reverse differentiation is irreversible and different from the one for differentiation process. We found that the developmental process described by the underlying landscape and the associated biological paths is relatively stable and robust against the influences of environmental perturbations.},

The lakes range from freshwater to hypersaline with a continuum of physical and chemical conditions that offer a natural laboratory in which to study evolution. Molecular studies on Antarctic lake communities are still in their infancy, but there is clear evidence from some taxonomic groups, for example the Cyanobacteria, that there is endemicity. Moreover, many of the bacteria have considerable potential as sources of novel biochemicals such as low temperature enzymes and anti-freeze proteins. Among the eukaryotic organisms survival strategies have evolved, among which dependence on mixotrophy in phytoflagellates and some ciliates is common. There is also some evidence of evolution of new species of flagellate in the marine derived saline lakes of the Vestfold Hills. Recent work on viruses in polar lakes demonstrates high abundance and high rates of infection, implying that they may play an important role in genetic exchange in these extreme environments.},

In this chapter, we describe a new method for extracting the local feature vectors of protein structures. Each residue is represented by a triangle, and the correlation between a set of residues is described by the distances between Calpha atoms and the angles between the normals of planes in which the triangles lie. The normalized local feature vectors are indexed using a suffix tree. For all query segments, suffix trees can be used effectively to retrieve the maximal matches, which are then chained to obtain alignments with database proteins. Similar proteins are selected by their alignment score against the query. Our results show classification accuracy up to 97.8 and 99.4\% at the superfamily and class level according to the SCOP classification and show that on average 7.49 out of 10 proteins from the same superfamily are obtained among the top 10 matches.

abstract = {There is a contradiction between Darwin's methodology and how he described it for public consumption. Darwin claimed that he proceeded "on true Baconian [inductive] principles and without any theory collected facts on a wholesale scale." He also wrote, "How odd it is that anyone should not see that all observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service!" The scientific method includes 2 episodes. The first consists of formulating hypotheses; the second consists of experimentally testing them. What differentiates science from other knowledge is the second episode: subjecting hypotheses to empirical testing by observing whether or not predictions derived from a hypothesis are the case in relevant observations and experiments. A hypothesis is scientific only if it is consistent with some but not other possible states of affairs not yet observed, so that it is subject to the possibility of falsification by reference to experience. Darwin occupies an exalted place in the history of Western thought, deservedly receiving credit for the theory of evolution. In The Origin of Species, he laid out the evidence demonstrating the evolution of organisms. More important yet is that he discovered natural selection, the process that accounts for the adaptations of organisms and their complexity and diversification. Natural selection and other causal processes of evolution are investigated by formulating and testing hypotheses. Darwin advanced hypotheses in multiple fields, including geology, plant morphology and physiology, psychology, and evolution, and subjected them to severe empirical tests.},

Recent research on many different bacterial species has now shown that the final stage in this life cycle includes the production and release of differentiated dispersal cells. The formation of these cells and their eventual dispersal is initiated through diverse and remarkably sophisticated mechanisms, suggesting that there are strong evolutionary pressures for dispersal from an otherwise largely sessile biofilm. The evolutionary aspect of biofilm dispersal is now being explored through the integration of molecular microbiology with eukaryotic ecological and evolutionary theory, which provides a broad conceptual framework for the diversity of specific mechanisms underlying biofilm dispersal. Here, we review recent progress in this emerging field and suggest that the merging of detailed molecular mechanisms with ecological theory will significantly advance our understanding of biofilm biology and ecology.},

This disco-ordinate regulation is due to increased transcription from a minor promoter upstream from rpoD, in the dnaG gene. Transcription from this promoter is also increased during the heat shock response. Expression of other heat shock proteins was found to increase during the stringent response. Thus, the stringent response in E. coli induces expression of heat shock proteins. The requirements for this stringent induction of the heat shock proteins differ from those for temperature induction during the heat shock response.},

abstract = {Base triples are recurrent clusters of three RNA nucleobases interacting edge-to-edge by hydrogen bonding. We find that the central base in almost all triples forms base pairs with the other two bases of the triple, providing a natural way to geometrically classify base triples. Given 12 geometric base pair families defined by the Leontis-Westhof nomenclature, combinatoric enumeration predicts 108 potential geometric base triple families. We searched representative atomic-resolution RNA 3D structures and found instances of 68 of the 108 predicted base triple families. Model building suggests that some of the remaining 40 families may be unlikely to form for steric reasons. We developed an on-line resource that provides exemplars of all base triples observed in the structure database and models for unobserved, predicted triples, grouped by triple family, as well as by three-base combination (http://rna.bgsu.edu/Triples). The classification helps to identify recurrent triple motifs that can substitute for each other while conserving RNA 3D structure, with applications in RNA 3D structure prediction and analysis of RNA sequence evolution.},

abstract = {Cellular immune control of HIV is mediated, in part, by induction of single amino acid mutations that reduce viral fitness, but compensatory mutations limit this effect. Here, we sought to determine if higher order constraints on viral evolution exist, because some coordinately linked combinations of mutations may hurt viability. Immune targeting of multiple sites in such a multidimensionally conserved region might render the virus particularly vulnerable, because viable escape pathways would be greatly restricted. We analyzed available HIV sequences using a method from physics to reveal distinct groups of amino acids whose mutations are collectively coordinated ("HIV sectors"). From the standpoint of mutations at individual sites, one such group in Gag is as conserved as other collectively coevolving groups of sites in Gag. However, it exhibits higher order conservation indicating constraints on the viability of viral strains with multiple mutations. Mapping amino acids from this group onto protein structures shows that combined mutations likely destabilize multiprotein structural interactions critical for viral function. Persons who durably control HIV without medications preferentially target the sector in Gag predicted to be most vulnerable. By sequencing circulating viruses from these individuals, we find that individual mutations occur with similar frequency in this sector as in other targeted Gag sectors. However, multiple mutations within this sector are very rare, indicating previously unrecognized multidimensional constraints on HIV evolution. Targeting such regions with higher order evolutionary constraints provides a novel approach to immunogen design for a vaccine against HIV and other rapidly mutating viruses.},

abstract = {Analysis of intragenomic variation of 16S rRNA genes is a unique approach to examining the concept of ribosomal constraints on rRNA genes; the degree of variation is an important parameter to consider for estimation of the diversity of a complex microbiome in the recently initiated Human Microbiome Project (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp). The current GenBank database has a collection of 883 prokaryotic genomes representing 568 unique species, of which 425 species contained 2 to 15 copies of 16S rRNA genes per genome (2.22 +/- 0.81). Sequence diversity among the 16S rRNA genes in a genome was found in 235 species (from 0.06\% to 20.38\%; 0.55\% +/- 1.46\%). Compared with the 16S rRNA-based threshold for operational definition of species (1 to 1.3\% diversity), the diversity was borderline (between 1\% and 1.3\%) in 10 species and >1.3\% in 14 species. The diversified 16S rRNA genes in Haloarcula marismortui (diversity, 5.63\%) and Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (6.70\%) were highly conserved at the 2 degrees structure level, while the diversified gene in B. afzelii (20.38\%) appears to be a pseudogene. The diversified genes in the remaining 21 species were also conserved, except for a truncated 16S rRNA gene in "Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila." Thus, this survey of intragenomic diversity of 16S rRNA genes provides strong evidence supporting the theory of ribosomal constraint. Taxonomic classification using the 16S rRNA-based operational threshold could misclassify a number of species into more than one species, leading to an overestimation of the diversity of a complex microbiome. This phenomenon is especially seen in 7 bacterial species associated with the human microbiome or diseases.},

If translated, these mRNAs can produce truncated proteins with dominant-negative or deleterious gain-of-function activities. In this review, we describe the molecular mechanism of NMD. We first cover conserved factors known to be involved in NMD in all eukaryotes. We then describe a unique protein complex that is deposited on mammalian mRNAs during splicing, which defines a stop codon as premature. Interaction between this exon-junction complex (EJC) and NMD factors assembled at the upstream stop codon triggers a series of steps that ultimately lead to mRNA decay. We discuss whether these proofreading events preferentially occur during a "pioneer" round of translation in higher and lower eukaryotes, their cellular location, and whether they can use alternative EJC factors or act independent of the EJC.},

Phage SFP10, which revealed effective infection of both S. enterica and E. coli O157:H7, was isolated and characterized. SFP10 contains a 158-kb double-stranded DNA genome belonging to the Vi01 phage-like family Myoviridae. In vitro adsorption assays showed that the adsorption constant rates to both Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 were 2.50 × 10⁻⁸ ml/min and 1.91 × 10⁻⁸ ml/min, respectively. One-step growth analysis revealed that SFP10 has a shorter latent period (25 min) and a larger burst size (>200 PFU) than ordinary Myoviridae phages, suggesting effective host infection and lytic activity. However, differential development of resistance to SFP10 in S. Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 was observed; bacteriophage-insensitive mutant (BIM) frequencies of 1.19 × 10⁻² CFU/ml for S. Typhimurium and 4.58 × 10⁻⁵ CFU/ml for E. coli O157:H7 were found, indicating that SFP10 should be active and stable for control of E. coli O157:H7 with minimal emergence of SFP10-resistant pathogens but may not be for S. Typhimurium. Specific mutation of rfaL in S. Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 revealed the O antigen as an SFP10 receptor for both bacteria. Genome sequence analysis of SFP10 and its comparative analysis with homologous Salmonella Vi01 and Shigella phiSboM-AG3 phages revealed that their tail fiber and tail spike genes share low sequence identity, implying that the genes are major host specificity determinants. This is the first report identifying specific infection and inhibition of Salmonella Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 by a single bacteriophage.},

Rational interconnection of these synthetic switches resulted in increasingly complex designer networks that execute input-triggered genetic instructions with precision, robustness and computational logic reminiscent of electronic circuits. Using trigger-controlled transcription factors, which independently control gene expression, and RNA-binding proteins that inhibit the translation of transcripts harbouring specific RNA target motifs, we have designed a set of synthetic transcription–translation control devices that could be rewired in a plug-and-play manner. Here we show that these combinatorial circuits integrated a two-molecule input and performed digital computations with NOT, AND, NAND and N-IMPLY expression logic in single mammalian cells. Functional interconnection of two N-IMPLY variants resulted in bitwise intracellular XOR operations, and a combinatorial arrangement of three logic gates enabled independent cells to perform programmable half-subtractor and half-adder calculations. Individual mammalian cells capable of executing basic molecular arithmetic functions isolated or coordinated to metabolic activities in a predictable, precise and robust manner may provide new treatment strategies and bio-electronic interfaces in future gene-based and cell-based therapies.},

abstract = {Isolates of 'Pseudomonas borealis' were recovered after ice-affinity selection of summer-collected soils. 'P. borealis' DL7 was further characterized and shown to have ice nucleation activity (INA), a property that allows the crystallization of ice at temperatures close to the melting point, effectively preventing the supercooling of water. INA was optimally detected after culturing at temperatures consistent with psychrophilic growth. The sequence encoding the 'P. borealis' ice nucleation protein (INP) was obtained using both PCR and chromosome walking. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the resulting inaPb recombinants had INA. The 'P. borealis' sequence, dubbed inaPb, is clearly related to previously cloned INP genes, but it shows greater divergence. Sequence analysis suggests that there are two opposite flat surfaces, one relatively hydrophobic that likely serves as an ice template, and the other that could function as a complementary face to facilitate interprotein interaction for ice-step formation.},

abstract = {Circular RNA forms had been described in all domains of life. Such RNAs were shown to have diverse biological functions, including roles in the life cycle of viral and viroid genomes, and in maturation of permuted tRNA genes. Despite their potentially important biological roles, discovery of circular RNAs has so far been mostly serendipitous. We have developed circRNA-seq, a combined experimental/computational approach that enriches for circular RNAs and allows profiling their prevalence in a whole-genome, unbiased manner. Application of this approach to the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 revealed multiple circular transcripts, a subset of which was further validated independently. The identified circular RNAs included expected forms, such as excised tRNA introns and rRNA processing intermediates, but were also enriched with non-coding RNAs, including C/D box RNAs and RNase P, as well as circular RNAs of unknown function. Many of the identified circles were conserved in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, further supporting their functional significance. Our results suggest that circular RNAs, and particularly circular non-coding RNAs, are more prevalent in archaea than previously recognized, and might have yet unidentified biological roles. Our study establishes a specific and sensitive approach for identification of circular RNAs using RNA-seq, and can readily be applied to other organisms.},

abstract = {A novel hyperthermophilic, heterotrophic, rod-shaped archaeon was isolated from a terrestrial hot spring at Oguni-cho, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. The new isolate, strain TE7T, grew under aerobic, microaerobic and anaerobic conditions. Isolate TE7T grew optimally at 90-94 degrees C and pH 7.0-7.5 (adjusted at 25 degrees C) under atmospheric air with vigorous shaking. Strain TE7T cells were motile rods 2-10 microm in length and covered with a surface-layer lattice. Cell yields at 90 degrees C under aerobic conditions were twice that under anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, growth was inhibited by elemental sulfur, but thiosulfate stimulated growth. Under anaerobic conditions, no growth was observed in the presence of nitrate and nitrite, but elemental sulfur, thiosulfate, L-cystine and oxidized glutathione stimulated growth. The 16S rDNA sequence of TE7T exhibited a close relationship to the sequences of Pyrobaculum aerophilum and Thermoproteus neutrophilus, which belong to the cluster of the genus Pyrobaculum. DNA-DNA hybridization analysis showed a low level of DNA similarity between TE7T and previously described Pyrobaculum species. As TE7T is phenotypically and phylogenetically different from the other members of this genus, it is described as a new species named Pyrobaculum oguniense (type strain TE7T = JCM 10595T = DSM 13380T).},

abstract = {Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmark neuropathological lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using a triple transgenic model (3xTg-AD) that develops both lesions in AD-relevant brain regions, we determined the consequence of Abeta clearance on the development of tau pathology. Here we show that Abeta immunotherapy reduces not only extracellular Abeta plaques but also intracellular Abeta accumulation and most notably leads to the clearance of early tau pathology. We find that Abeta deposits are cleared first and subsequently reemerge prior to the tau pathology, indicative of a hierarchical and direct relationship between Abeta and tau. The clearance of the tau pathology is mediated by the proteasome and is dependent on the phosphorylation state of tau, as hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates are unaffected by the Abeta antibody treatment. These findings indicate that Abeta immunization may be useful for clearing both hallmark lesions of AD, provided that intervention occurs early in the disease course.},

abstract = {Differential scanning calorimetry of whole Escherichia coil cells allowed the detection in vivo of changes in ribosome conformation. This enabled for the first time an analysis of the effects of high hydrostatic pressures on ribosomes in living cells. A correlation was observed between loss of cell viability and decrease in ribosome-associated enthalpy in cells subjected to pressures of 50-250 MPa for 20 min. Cell death and ribosome damage were therefore closely related phenomena. In pressure-treated cells, the thermogram peak temperatures decreased, suggesting that the remaining ribosomes had adopted a less stable conformation. During subsequent incubation of the cultures at 37 degrees C, peak temperatures and enthalpies gradually increased over a period of 5 h. This change in ribosome conformation had no apparent effect on cell survival, as viability continued to decrease. The addition of 5 mM MgCl2 before pressure treatment of cells prevented the reduction in stability of surviving ribosomes but had no effect on the initial loss of enthalpy or on cell viability.},

@article{DiGiulio2005,
abstract = {A comparison is made between orthologous proteins from a nonbarophile (Pyrococcus furiosus) and a barophile (Pyrococcus abyssi) organism. The pattern of asymmetries in the amino acid substitution process identifies the amino acids arginine, serine, glycine, valine and aspartic acid as those having the most barophilic behaviour, and tyrosine and glutamine as the least barophilic. The construction of a hydrostatic pressure asymmetry index (PAI) which orders the amino acids from the most barophilic to the least barophilic makes it possible to visualise the amino acid properties that best explain barophily. The polarity of amino acids is positively correlated to the PAI values, i.e., on average, the more polar amino acids possess a higher PAI value, that is to say they are more barophilic. Moreover, the "size" of amino acids (molecular weight) is negatively correlated to the PAI value, that is to say that, on average, high PAI values are associated to "small" amino acids which are therefore more barophilic than "larger" ones. These two amino acid properties are the same ones that are known for having been important in affecting the origin of genetic code organisation. All the above, as well as the significant and positive correlation between the number of codons attributed to the amino acids in the genetic code and the PAI values, seem to favour the hypothesis that genetic code structuring took place under high hydrostatic pressure.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the subject of enormous interest. They are small non-coding RNAs that play a regulatory role in numerous and diverse cellular processes such as immune function, apoptosis and tumorigenesis. Several virus families have been shown to encode miRNAs, and an appreciation for their roles in the viral infectious cycle continues to grow. Despite the identification of numerous (>225) viral miRNAs, an in depth functional understanding of most virus-encoded miRNAs is lacking. Here we focus on a few viral miRNAs with well-defined functions. We use these examples to extrapolate general themes of viral miRNA activities including autoregulation of viral gene expression, avoidance of host defenses, and a likely important role in maintaining latent and persistent infections. We hypothesize that although the molecular mechanisms and machinery are similar, the majority of viral miRNAs may utilize a target strategy that differs from host miRNAs. That is, many viral miRNAs may have evolved to regulate viral-encoded transcripts or networks of host genes that are unique to viral miRNAs. Included in this latter category is a likely abundant class of viral miRNAs that may regulate only one or a few principal host genes. Key steps forward for the field are discussed, including the need for additional functional studies that utilize surgical viral miRNA mutants combined with relevant models of infection.},

Phylogenetic analysis of almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequences from three representative strains (two from Japan, one from Scotland) placed them in the genus Lactobacillus as members of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group. Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus gallinarum were the most closely related species, with 16S rRNA gene similarities of 99.3 and 98.1 \%, respectively. A similar phylogeny was derived from partial sequences of elongation factor Tu (tuf) genes in which the alleles from the three distillery isolates were identical and shared 99.0 \% similarity with L. helveticus and L. gallinarum tuf genes. S-layer (slp) gene sequences suggested different relationships among the strains and the distillery isolates no longer formed a monophyletic group. The alleles from the Japanese and Scottish strains shared only 54 \% similarity. Chromosomal DNA from the distillery strains gave DNA-DNA hybridization values between 79 and 100 \% but showed less than 43 and 22 \% reassociation with L. helveticus and L. gallinarum DNA, respectively.

abstract = {Predicting secondary structures of RNA molecules is one of the fundamental problems of and thus a challenging task in computational structural biology. Over the past decades, mainly two different approaches have been considered to compute predictions of RNA secondary structures from a single sequence: the first one relies on physics-based and the other on probabilistic RNA models. Particularly, the free energy minimization (MFE) approach is usually considered the most popular and successful method. Moreover, based on the paradigm-shifting work by McCaskill which proposes the computation of partition functions (PFs) and base pair probabilities based on thermodynamics, several extended partition function algorithms, statistical sampling methods and clustering techniques have been invented over the last years. However, the accuracy of the corresponding algorithms is limited by the quality of underlying physics-based models, which include a vast number of thermodynamic parameters and are still incomplete. The competing probabilistic approach is based on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) or corresponding generalizations, like conditional log-linear models (CLLMs). These methods abstract from free energies and instead try to learn about the structural behavior of the molecules by learning (a manageable number of) probabilistic parameters from trusted RNA structure databases. In this work, we introduce and evaluate a sophisticated SCFG design that mirrors state-of-the-art physics-based RNA structure prediction procedures by distinguishing between all features of RNA that imply different energy rules. This SCFG actually serves as the foundation for a statistical sampling algorithm for RNA secondary structures of a single sequence that represents a probabilistic counterpart to the sampling extension of the PF approach. Furthermore, some new ways to derive meaningful structure predictions from generated sample sets are presented. They are used to compare the predictive accuracy of our model to that of other probabilistic and energy-based prediction methods. Particularly, comparisons to lightweight SCFGs and corresponding CLLMs for RNA structure prediction indicate that more complex SCFG designs might yield higher accuracy but eventually require more comprehensive and pure training sets. Investigations on both the accuracies of predicted foldings and the overall quality of generated sample sets (especially on an abstraction level, called abstract shapes of generated structures, that is relevant for biologists) yield the conclusion that the Boltzmann distribution of the PF sampling approach is more centered than the ensemble distribution induced by the sophisticated SCFG model, which implies a greater structural diversity within generated samples. In general, neither of the two distinct ensemble distributions is more adequate than the other and the corresponding results obtained by statistical sampling can be expected to bare fundamental differences, such that the method to be preferred for a particular input sequence strongly depends on the considered RNA type.},

abstract = {Pseudouridine synthase 1 (Pus1p) is an unusual site-specific modification enzyme in that it can modify a number of positions in tRNAs and can recognize several other types of RNA. No consensus recognition sequence or structure has been identified for Pus1p. Human Pus1p was used to determine which structural or sequence elements of human tRNA(Ser) are necessary for pseudouridine ($\Psi$) formation at position 28 in the anticodon stem-loop (ASL). Some point mutations in the ASL stem of tRNA(Ser) had significant effects on the levels of modification and compensatory mutation, to reform the base pair, restored a wild-type level of $\Psi$ formation. Deletion analysis showed that the tRNA(Ser) T$\Psi$C stem-loop was a determinant for modification in the ASL. A mini-substrate composed of the ASL and T$\Psi$C stem-loop exhibited significant $\Psi$ formation at position 28 and a number of mutants were tested. Substantial base pairing in the ASL stem (3 out of 5 bp) is required, but the sequence of the T$\Psi$C loop is not required for modification. When all nucleotides in the ASL stem other than U28 were changed in a single mutant, but base pairing was retained, a near wild-type level of modification was observed.},

In recent years, however, the very notion of a scientific revolution has come under attack, and in the specific case of Charles Darwin and his Origin of Species there are serious questions about the nature of the change (if there was such) and the specifically Darwinian input. This article considers these issues by addressing these questions: Was there a Darwinian revolution? That is, was there a revolution at all? Was there a Darwinian revolution? That is, what was the specific contribution of Charles Darwin? Was there a Darwinian revolution? That is, what was the conceptual nature of what occurred on and around the publication of the Origin? I argue that there was a major change, both scientifically and in a broader metaphysical sense; that Charles Darwin was the major player in the change, although one must qualify the nature and the extent of the change, looking particularly at things in a broader historical context than just as an immediate event; and that the revolution was complex and we need the insights of rather different philosophies of scientific change to capture the whole phenomenon. In some respects, indeed, the process of analysis is still ongoing and unresolved.},

But statistical graphics still occupies an awkward in-between position: Within statistics, exploratory and graphical methods represent a minor subfield and are not well- integrated with larger themes of modeling and inference. Outside of statistics, infographics (also called information visualization or Infovis) is huge, but their purveyors and enthusiasts appear largely to be uninterested in statistical principles. We present here a set of goals for graphical displays discussed primarily from the statistical point of view and discuss some inherent contradictions in these goals that may be impeding communication between the fields of statistics and Infovis. One of our constructive suggestions, to Infovis practitioners and statisticians alike, is to try not to cram into a single graph what can be better displayed in two or more. We recognize that we offer only one perspective and intend this article to be a starting point for a wide-ranging discussion among graphics designers, statisticians, and users of statistical methods. The purpose of this article is not to criticize but to explore the different goals that lead researchers in different fields to value different aspects of data visualization.},

They constitute the modular building blocks of RNA architecture, which is organized hierarchically. Recent work has focused on analyzing RNA backbone conformations to identify, define and search for new instances of recurrent motifs in X-ray structures. One current view asserts that recurrent RNA strand segments with characteristic backbone configurations qualify as independent motifs. Other considerations indicate that, to characterize modular motifs, one must take into account the larger structural context of such strand segments. This follows the biologically relevant motivation, which is to identify RNA structural characteristics that are subject to sequence constraints and that thus relate RNA architectures to sequences.},

abstract = {The control of rRNA synthesis in response to both extra- and intracellular signals has been a subject of interest to microbial physiologists for nearly four decades, beginning with the observations that Salmonella typhimurium cells grown on rich medium are larger and contain more RNA than those grown on poor medium. This was followed shortly by the discovery of the stringent response in Escherichia coli, which has continued to be the organism of choice for the study of rRNA synthesis. In this review, we summarize four general areas of E. coli rRNA transcription control: stringent control, growth rate regulation, upstream activation, and anti-termination. We also cite similar mechanisms in other bacteria and eukaryotes. The separation of growth rate-dependent control of rRNA synthesis from stringent control continues to be a subject of controversy. One model holds that the nucleotide ppGpp is the key effector for both mechanisms, while another school holds that it is unlikely that ppGpp or any other single effector is solely responsible for growth rate-dependent control. Recent studies on activation of rRNA synthesis by cis-acting upstream sequences has led to the discovery of a new class of promoters that make contact with RNA polymerase at a third position, called the UP element, in addition to the well-known -10 and -35 regions. Lastly, clues as to the role of antitermination in rRNA operons have begun to appear. Transcription complexes modified at the antiterminator site appear to elongate faster and are resistant to the inhibitory effects of ppGpp during the stringent response.},

abstract = {Prochlorococcus cyanobacteria are extremely abundant in the oceans, as are the viruses that infect them. How hosts and viruses coexist in nature remains unclear, although the presence of both susceptible and resistant cells may allow this coexistence. Combined whole-genome sequencing and PCR screening technology now enables us to investigate the effect of resistance on genome evolution and the genomic mechanisms behind the long-term coexistence of Prochlorococcus and their viruses. Here we present a genome analysis of 77 substrains selected for resistance to ten viruses, revealing mutations primarily in non-conserved, horizontally transferred genes that localize to a single hypervariable genomic island. Mutations affected viral attachment to the cell surface and imposed a fitness cost to the host, manifested by significantly lower growth rates or a previously unknown mechanism of more rapid infection by other viruses. The mutant genes are generally uncommon in nature yet some carry polymorphisms matching those found experimentally. These data are empirical evidence indicating that viral-attachment genes are preferentially located in genomic islands and that viruses are a selective pressure enhancing the diversity of both island genes and island gene content. This diversity emerges as a genomic mechanism that reduces the effective host population size for infection by a given virus, thus facilitating long-term coexistence between viruses and their hosts in nature.},

abstract = {New thermoacidophilic organisms that were able to grow anaerobically on starch were isolated from the acidic hot springs of Kamchatka. Strain 1904T, isolated from a hot spring of the Moutnovski volcano, was characterized in detail. Its cells were regular or irregular cocci that were 1-2 microm in diameter, non-motile, and had a cell envelope consisting of one layer of subunits. The new organism was a hyperthermophile, growing in the temperature range 60-92 degrees C (with an optimum at 85 degrees C), an acidophile, having the pH range for growth of 2.0-6.0 (with an optimum at 3.8), and an obligate anaerobe. It fermented starch, forming acetate as the main growth product. Other growth substrates were yeast extract, beef extract and soya extract. Growth on yeast extract, beef extract and soya extract was stimulated by elemental sulfur, which was reduced to H2S. Acetate, arabinose, cellulose, formate, fructose, galactose, glucose, glycine, guar gum, lichenan, malate, maltose, methanol, pectin, pyruvate, propionate, xylan, xylose or a mixture of amino acids failed to support growth both in the presence and the absence of sulfur. When starch was used as the growth substrate, yeast extract (100 mg l(-1)) was required as a growth factor. The G+C content of the DNA was found to be 53.8 mol\%. Comparison of the complete 16S rDNA sequence with databases revealed that the new isolate belonged to the kingdom Crenarchaeota. It was not closely related to any described genera (showing sequence similarity below 90.8\%) and formed a separate branch of the Crenarchaeota. On the basis of physiological differences and rRNA sequence data, a new genus--Acidilobus--is proposed, the type species being Acidilobus aceticus strain 1904T (= DSM 11585T).},

abstract = {Closely related pathogens may differ dramatically in host range, but the molecular, genetic, and evolutionary basis for these differences remains unclear. In many Gram- negative bacteria, including the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae, type III effectors (TTEs) are essential for pathogenicity, instrumental in structuring host range, and exhibit wide diversity between strains. To capture the dynamic nature of virulence gene repertoires across P. syringae, we screened 11 diverse strains for novel TTE families and coupled this nearly saturating screen with the sequencing and assembly of 14 phylogenetically diverse isolates from a broad collection of diseased host plants. TTE repertoires vary dramatically in size and content across all P. syringae clades; surprisingly few TTEs are conserved and present in all strains. Those that are likely provide basal requirements for pathogenicity. We demonstrate that functional divergence within one conserved locus, hopM1, leads to dramatic differences in pathogenicity, and we demonstrate that phylogenetics-informed mutagenesis can be used to identify functionally critical residues of TTEs. The dynamism of the TTE repertoire is mirrored by diversity in pathways affecting the synthesis of secreted phytotoxins, highlighting the likely role of both types of virulence factors in determination of host range. We used these 14 draft genome sequences, plus five additional genome sequences previously reported, to identify the core genome for P. syringae and we compared this core to that of two closely related non-pathogenic pseudomonad species.

abstract = {The crystal structure of a subtilisin-like serine proteinase from the psychrotrophic marine bacterium, Vibrio sp. PA-44, was solved by means of molecular replacement and refined at 1.84 A. This is the first structure of a cold-adapted subtilase to be determined and its elucidation facilitates examination of the molecular principles underlying temperature adaptation in enzymes. The cold-adapted Vibrio proteinase was compared with known three-dimensional structures of homologous enzymes of meso- and thermophilic origin, proteinase K and thermitase, to which it has high structural resemblance. The main structural features emerging as plausible determinants of temperature adaptation in the enzymes compared involve the character of their exposed and buried surfaces, which may be related to temperature-dependent variation in the physical properties of water. Thus, the hydrophobic effect is found to play a significant role in the structural stability of the meso- and thermophile enzymes, whereas the cold-adapted enzyme has more of its apolar surface exposed. In addition, the cold-adapted Vibrio proteinase is distinguished from the more stable enzymes by its strong anionic character arising from the high occurrence of uncompensated negatively charged residues at its surface. Interestingly, both the cold-adapted and thermophile proteinases differ from the mesophile enzyme in having more extensive hydrogen- and ion pair interactions in their structures; this supports suggestions of a dual role of electrostatic interactions in the adaptation of enzymes to both high and low temperatures. The Vibrio proteinase has three calcium ions associated with its structure, one of which is in a calcium-binding site not described in other subtilases.},

These strains differed in their morphology, temperature range and optimum for growth, energy substrates and 16S rRNA gene sequences. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 41 mol\% (SL22(T)), 42 mol\% (SL17(T)) and 46 mol\% (SL19(T)). Comparative analysis of phenotypic and phylogenetic traits indicated that strains SL17(T) and SL22(T) represented two novel species of the genus Desulfurobacterium and that strain SL19(T) should be considered as a novel species of the genus Thermovibrio. The names Desulfurobacterium pacificum sp. nov. (type strain SL17(T)=DSM 15522(T)=JCM 12127(T)), Desulfurobacterium atlanticum sp. nov. (type strain SL22(T)=DSM 15668(T)=JCM 12129(T)) and Thermovibrio guaymasensis sp. nov. (type strain SL19(T)=DSM 15521(T)=JCM 12128(T)) are proposed for these organisms. Furthermore, phylogenetic data based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses correlated with the significant phenotypic differences between members of the lineage encompassing the genera Desulfurobacterium, Thermovibrio and Balnearium and that of the families Aquificaceae and Hydrogenothermaceae. It is therefore proposed that this lineage represents a new family, Desulfurobacteriaceae fam. nov., within the order Aquificales.},

abstract = {The issues of microbial taxonomy and potential interactions with a microbial commons are discussed, with emphasis on three components: characterization; classification; and nomenclature. The current state of technology and the spectrum of methods that are used for phenotypic and genotypic characterization of prokaryotes, classification at different taxonomic levels and points of prokaryote nomenclature are reviewed. While all taxonomic ranks comprise a cohesive systematic framework for microorganisms, the prokaryotic genus and species provide the "working unit" of taxonomy. Since 2004, the number of validly published genera and species has increased by approximately 50\%. Extensive development of technology will continue to enable ever higher resolution characterization and more refined classification of microorganisms. Characterization and classification at the species level may be most relevant for bacterial taxonomy, although reproducible differentiation at the strain level will probably prove to be more relevant for a microbial commons. A dynamic microbial taxonomy, albeit with well-founded and stable guidelines for defining microorganisms, provides an efficient organizational system for dealing with the enormous spectrum of microbial diversity.},

abstract = {A cell-fusing hyperthermophilic archaeon was isolated from hydrothermal fluid obtained from Suiyo Seamount of the Izu-Bonin Arc. The isolate, TS1(T), is an irregular coccus, usually 0.5-2 microm in diameter and motile with a polar tuft of flagella. Cells in the exponential phase of growth fused at room temperature in the presence of DNA-intercalating dye to become as large as 5 microm in diameter. Fused cells showed dark spots that moved along in the cytoplasm. Large cells with a similar appearance were also observed upon culture at 87 degrees C, suggesting the occurrence of similar cell fusions during growth. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that cells in the exponential phase possessed a thin and electron-lucent cell envelope that could be lost subsequently during culture. The fragile cell envelope must be related to cell fusion. The cells grew at 57-90 degrees C, pH 5.2-8.7 and at NaCl concentrations of 1.5-4.5 \%, with the optima being 87 degrees C, pH 6.5 and 2.5 \% NaCl. The isolate was an anaerobic chemo-organotroph that grew on either yeast extract or tryptone as the sole growth substrate. The genomic DNA G+C content was 53.9 mol\%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that the isolate was closely related to Thermococcus species. However, no significant DNA-DNA hybridization was observed between genomic DNA of strain TS1(T) and phylogenetically related Thermococcus species. We propose that isolate TS1(T) represents a novel species, Thermococcus coalescens sp. nov., with the name reflecting the cell fusion activity observed in the strain. The type strain is TS1(T) (=JCM 12540T=DSM 16538T).},

abstract = {TraJ is the essential activator of P(Y), the promoter of the F and F-like plasmid tra operon that encodes the majority of the proteins for bacterial conjugation. By combining error-prone PCR mutagenesis with a two-plasmid screen, we isolated 55 missense mutations in traJ, each affecting the ability of TraJ to activate P(Y). These mutations define two distinct functional clusters (amino acids [aa] 21 to 117 and aa 150 to 219). Limited proteolytic analysis of TraJ suggested that the N- and C-terminal functional clusters are two structurally distinct domains. Most TraJ mutants exhibited decreased intracellular protein levels, and the HslVU protease-chaperone pair was found to be responsible for degrading those mutants without extracytoplasmic stress-induced overexpression. In vivo cross-linking analysis of TraJ mutants indicated that the N-terminal domain is responsible for dimerization. This was confirmed by the finding that the purified N-terminal region of TraJ forms dimers in solution. The levels of dimerization and in vivo activities of TraJ mutants are well correlated, suggesting that dimerization of TraJ is required for its biological function. We propose that the regulation of TraJ dimerization and/or its susceptibility to HslVU could be a key mechanism in various signaling processes for controlling bacterial conjugation in response to physiological or environmental stimuli.},

abstract = {'Ribosome scanning' is the generally accepted mechanism for explaining how a ribosome finds an initiation codon located far removed from the ribosome recruiting site (cap structure). However, the molecular characteristics of ribosome scanning along 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) remain obscure. Herein, using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) system and artificial ribonucleic acid (RNA) constructs composed of a capped leader RNA and an uncapped reporter RNA annealed through a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) bridge, we show that the ribosome can efficiently bypass a stable, dsRNA region without melting the structure. The insertion of an upstream open reading frame in the capped leader RNA impaired the translation of reporter RNA, indicating that a ribosome associated with the 5'-end explores the regions upstream of the dsRNA bridge in search of the initiation codon. These data indicate that a ribosome may skip part(s) of an messenger RNA 5'UTR without thoroughly scanning it.},

Antarctic lakes are microbially dominated ecosystems supporting truncated food webs in which viruses exert a major influence on the microbial loop. Here we report the discovery of a virophage (relative of the recently described Sputnik virophage) that preys on phycodnaviruses that infect prasinophytes (phototrophic algae). By performing metaproteogenomic analysis on samples from Organic Lake, a hypersaline meromictic lake in Antarctica, complete virophage and near-complete phycodnavirus genomes were obtained. By introducing the virophage as an additional predator of a predator-prey dynamic model we determined that the virophage stimulates secondary production through the microbial loop by reducing overall mortality of the host and increasing the frequency of blooms during polar summer light periods. Virophages remained abundant in the lake 2 y later and were represented by populations with a high level of major capsid protein sequence variation (25-100\% identity). Virophage signatures were also found in neighboring Ace Lake (in abundance) and in two tropical lakes (hypersaline and fresh), an estuary, and an ocean upwelling site. These findings indicate that virophages regulate host-virus interactions, influence overall carbon flux in Organic Lake, and play previously unrecognized roles in diverse aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {Prokaryotic toxin-antitoxin (TA) loci consist of two genes in an operon that encodes a metabolically stable toxin and an unstable antitoxin. The antitoxin neutralizes its cognate toxin by forming a tight complex with it. In all cases known, the antitoxin autoregulates TA operon transcription by binding to one or more operators in the promoter region while the toxin functions as a co-repressor of transcription. Interestingly, the toxin can also stimulate TA operon transcription. Here we analyse mechanistic aspects of how RelE of Escherichia coli can function both as a co-repressor and as a derepressor of relBE transcription. When RelB was in excess to RelE, two trimeric RelB(2)*RelE complexes bound cooperatively to two adjacent operator sites in the relBE promoter region and repressed transcription. In contrast, RelE in excess stimulated relBE transcription and released the RelB(2)*RelE complex from operator DNA. A mutational analysis of the operator sites showed that RelE in excess counteracted cooperative binding of the RelB(2)*RelE complexes to the operator sites. Thus, RelE controls relBE transcription by conditional cooperativity.},

Thus in the future, kinetic and thermodynamic experiments will become increasingly important, and as they do, the field will have to start thinking about the dynamics of the ribosome far more carefully than it has in the past.

abstract = {Studies of cold-active enzymes have provided basic information on the molecular and biochemical properties of psychrophiles; however, the physiological strategies that compensate for low-temperature metabolism remain poorly understood. We investigated the cellular pools of ATP and ADP in Psychrobacter cryohalolentis K5 incubated at eight temperatures between 22 degrees C and -80 degrees C. Cellular ATP and ADP concentrations increased with decreasing temperature, and the most significant increases were observed in cells that were incubated as frozen suspensions (<-5 degrees C). Respiratory uncoupling significantly decreased this temperature-dependent response, indicating that the proton motive force was required for energy adaptation to frozen conditions. Since ATP and ADP are key substrates in metabolic and energy conservation reactions, increasing their concentrations may provide a strategy for offsetting the kinetic temperature effect, thereby maintaining reaction rates at low temperature. The adenylate levels increased significantly <1 h after freezing and also when the cells were osmotically shocked to simulate the elevated solute concentrations encountered in the liquid fraction of the ice. Together, these data demonstrate that a substantial change in cellular energy metabolism is required for the cell to adapt to the low temperature and water activity conditions encountered during freezing. This physiological response may represent a critical biochemical compensation mechanism at low temperature, have relevance to cellular survival during freezing, and be important for the persistence of microorganisms in icy environments.},

abstract = {The sarcin/ricin domain (SRD) in Escherichia coli 23 S rRNA forms a part of the site for the association of the elongation factors with the ribosome and hence is critical for the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA and for translocation. The domain is also the site of action of the eponymous toxins which catalyze covalent modification of single nucleotides that inactivate the ribosome. The conformation of the conserved guanosine at position 2655 is an especially prominent feature of the structure of the SRD: the nucleotide is bulged out of a helix and forms a base-triple with A2665 and U2656. G2655 in 23 S rRNA is protected from chemical modification when the elongation factors, EF-Tu and EF-G, are bound to ribosomes and the analog of G2655 in oligoribonucleotides is critical for recognition by the toxin sarcin and by EF-G. The contribution of G2655 to the function of the ribosome has been evaluated by constructing mutations in the nucleotide and determining the phenotype. Constitutive expression of a plasmid-encoded rrnB operon with a deletion of, or transversions in, G2655 is lethal to E. coli cells, whereas a defect in the growth of cells with a G2655A transition is observed only in competition with wild-type cells. The sedimentation profiles of ribosomes with mutations in G2655 are altered; most markedly by deletion or transversion of the nucleotide, less severely by transition to adenosine. Mutations of G2655 confer resistance to sarcin on ribosomes. Ribosomes with G2655Delta, G2655C, or G2655U mutations in 23 S rRNA are not active in protein synthesis, whereas those with the G2655A transition mutation suffer decreased activity.},

abstract = {The paranemic crossover (PX) is a motif for assembling two nucleic acid molecules using Watson-Crick (WC) basepairing without unfolding preformed secondary structure in the individual molecules. Once formed, the paranemic assembly motif comprises adjacent parallel double helices that crossover at every possible point over the length of the motif. The interaction is reversible as it does not require denaturation of basepairs internal to each interacting molecular unit. Paranemic assembly has been demonstrated for DNA but not for RNA and only for motifs with four or more crossover points and lengths of five or more helical half-turns. Here we report the design of RNA molecules that paranemically assemble with the minimum number of two crossovers spanning the major groove to form paranemic motifs with a length of three half turns (3HT). Dissociation constants (Kd's) were measured for a series of molecules in which the number of basepairs between the crossover points was varied from five to eight basepairs. The paranemic 3HT complex with six basepairs (3HT\_6M) was found to be the most stable with Kd = 1 x 10-8 M. The half-time for kinetic exchange of the 3HT\_6M complex was determined to be approximately 100 min, from which we calculated association and dissociation rate constants ka = 5.11 x 103 M-1s-1 and kd = 5.11 x 10-5 s-1. RNA paranemic assembly of 3HT and 5HT complexes is blocked by single-base substitutions that disrupt individual intermolecular Watson-Crick basepairs and is restored by compensatory substitutions that restore those basepairs. The 3HT motif appears suitable for specific, programmable, and reversible tecto-RNA self-assembly for constructing artificial RNA molecular machines.},

abstract = {Initiation of translation involves recognition of the start codon by the initiator tRNA in the 30S subunit. To investigate the role of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in this process, we isolated a number of 16S rRNA mutations that increase translation from the non-canonical start codon AUC. These mutations cluster to distinct regions that overlap remarkably well with previously identified class III protection sites and implicate both IF1 and IF3 in start codon selection. Two mutations map to the 790 loop and presumably act by inhibiting IF3 binding. Another cluster of mutations surrounds the conserved A1413(o)G1487 base pair of helix 44 in a region known to be distorted by IF1 and IF3. Site-directed mutagenesis in this region confirmed that this factor-induced rearrangement of helix 44 helps regulate initiation fidelity. A third cluster of mutations maps to the neck of the 30S subunit, suggesting that the dynamics of the head domain influences translation initiation. In addition to identifying mutations that decrease fidelity, we found that many P-site mutations increase the stringency of start codon selection. These data provide evidence that the interaction between the initiator tRNA and the 30S P site is tuned to balance efficiency and accuracy during initiation.},

To maintain metabolic rates compatible with sustained life, they have improved the dynamics of their protein structures, thereby enabling appropriate molecular motions required for biological activity at low temperatures. As a consequence of this structural flexibility, psychrophilic proteins are unstable and heat-labile. In the upper range of biological temperatures, thermophiles and hyperthermophiles grow at temperatures > 100 °C and synthesize ultra-stable proteins. However, thermophilic enzymes are nearly inactive at room temperature as a result of their compactness and rigidity. At the molecular level, both types of extremophilic proteins have adapted the same structural factors, but in opposite directions, to address either activity at low temperatures or stability in hot environments. A model based on folding funnels is proposed accounting for the stability-activity relationships in extremophilic proteins.},

abstract = {Despite the importance of local structural detail to a mechanistic understanding of RNA catalysis and binding functions, RNA backbone conformation has been quite recalcitrant to analysis. There are too many variable torsion angles per residue, and their raw empirical distributions are poorly clustered. This study applies quality-filtering techniques (using resolution, crystallographic B factor, and all-atom steric clashes) to the backbone torsion angle distributions from an 8,636-residue RNA database. With noise levels greatly reduced, clear signal appears for the underlying angle preferences. Half-residue torsion angle distributions for alpha-beta-gamma and for delta-epsilon-zeta are plotted and contoured in 3D; each shows about a dozen distinct peaks, which can then be combined in pairs to define complete RNA backbone conformers. Traditional nucleic acid residues are defined from phosphate to phosphate, but here we use a base-to-base (or sugar-to-sugar) division into "suites" to parse the RNA backbone repeats, both because most backbone steric clashes are within suites and because the relationship of successive bases is both reliably determined and conformationally important. A suite conformer has seven variables, with sugar pucker specified at both ends. Potential suite conformers were omitted if not represented by at least a small cluster of convincing data points after application of quality filters. The final result is a small library of 42 RNA backbone conformers, which should provide valid conformations for nearly all RNA backbone encountered in experimental structures.},

abstract = {New methods are described for finding recurrent three-dimensional (3D) motifs in RNA atomic-resolution structures. Recurrent RNA 3D motifs are sets of RNA nucleotides with similar spatial arrangements. They can be local or composite. Local motifs comprise nucleotides that occur in the same hairpin or internal loop. Composite motifs comprise nucleotides belonging to three or more different RNA strand segments or molecules. We use a base-centered approach to construct efficient, yet exhaustive search procedures using geometric, symbolic, or mixed representations of RNA structure that we implement in a suite of MATLAB programs, "Find RNA 3D" (FR3D). The first modules of FR3D preprocess structure files to classify base-pair and -stacking interactions. Each base is represented geometrically by the position of its glycosidic nitrogen in 3D space and by the rotation matrix that describes its orientation with respect to a common frame. Base-pairing and base-stacking interactions are calculated from the base geometries and are represented symbolically according to the Leontis/Westhof basepairing classification, extended to include base-stacking. These data are stored and used to organize motif searches. For geometric searches, the user supplies the 3D structure of a query motif which FR3D uses to find and score geometrically similar candidate motifs, without regard to the sequential position of their nucleotides in the RNA chain or the identity of their bases. To score and rank candidate motifs, FR3D calculates a geometric discrepancy by rigidly rotating candidates to align optimally with the query motif and then comparing the relative orientations of the corresponding bases in the query and candidate motifs. Given the growing size of the RNA structure database, it is impossible to explicitly compute the discrepancy for all conceivable candidate motifs, even for motifs with less than ten nucleotides. The screening algorithm that we describe finds all candidate motifs whose geometric discrepancy with respect to the query motif falls below a user-specified cutoff discrepancy. This technique can be applied to RMSD searches. Candidate motifs identified geometrically may be further screened symbolically to identify those that contain particular basepair types or base-stacking arrangements or that conform to sequence continuity or nucleotide identity constraints. Purely symbolic searches for motifs containing user-defined sequence, continuity and interaction constraints have also been implemented. We demonstrate that FR3D finds all occurrences, both local and composite and with nucleotide substitutions, of sarcin/ricin and kink-turn motifs in the 23S and 5S ribosomal RNA 3D structures of the H. marismortui 50S ribosomal subunit and assigns the lowest discrepancy scores to bona fide examples of these motifs. The search algorithms have been optimized for speed to allow users to search the non-redundant RNA 3D structure database on a personal computer in a matter of minutes.},

To understand how the ribosome triggers GTP hydrolysis in translational GTPases, we have determined the crystal structure of EF-Tu and aminoacyl-tRNA bound to the ribosome with a GTP analog, to 3.2 angstrom resolution. EF-Tu is in its active conformation, the switch I loop is ordered, and the catalytic histidine is coordinating the nucleophilic water in position for inline attack on the $\gamma$-phosphate of GTP. This activated conformation is due to a critical and conserved interaction of the histidine with A2662 of the sarcin-ricin loop of the 23S ribosomal RNA. The structure suggests a universal mechanism for GTPase activation and hydrolysis in translational GTPases on the ribosome.},

COPII subunits are recruited to the ER membrane where they mediate the selection of cargo for transport to the Golgi, and also membrane deformation and vesicle formation. New ER exit sites can be generated by lateral growth and medial fission (in Pythium sp.) or by de novo formation (in Pichia pastoris) but it is not known how mammalian ER exit sites form. Here, time-lapse imaging of COPII-coated structures in live mammalian cells reveals that the number of ER export sites increases greatly during interphase by de novo formation. These results show the fusion of pre-existing ER export sites and the fission of larger structures. These three mechanisms of de novo formation, fusion and fission probably cooperate to regulate the size of these sites in mammalian cells.},

abstract = {Sexual selection in natural populations acts on highly heritable traits and tends to be relatively strong, implicating sexual selection as a causal agent in many phenotypic radiations. Sexual selection appears to be ineffectual in promoting phenotypic divergence among contemporary natural populations, however, and there is little evidence from artificial selection experiments that sexual fitness can evolve. Here, we demonstrate that a multivariate male trait preferred by Drosophila serrata females can respond to selection and results in the maintenance of male mating success. The response to selection was associated with a gene of major effect increasing in frequency from 12 to 35\% in seven generations. No further response to selection, or increase in frequency of the major gene, was observed between generations 7 and 11, indicating an evolutionary limit had been reached. Genetic analyses excluded both depletion of genetic variation and overdominance as causes of the evolutionary limit. Relaxing artificial selection resulted in the loss of 52\% of the selection response after a further five generations, demonstrating that the response under artificial sexual selection was opposed by antagonistic natural selection. We conclude that male D. serrata sexually selected traits, and attractiveness to D. serrata females conferred by these traits, were held at an evolutionary limit by the lack of genetic variation that would allow an increase in sexual fitness while simultaneously maintaining nonsexual fitness. Our results suggest that sexual selection is unlikely to cause divergence among natural populations without a concomitant change in natural selection, a conclusion consistent with observational evidence from natural populations.},

abstract = {Chemical and enzymatic footprinting experiments, such as shape (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension), yield important information about RNA secondary structure. Indeed, since the [Formula: see text]-hydroxyl is reactive at flexible (loop) regions, but unreactive at base-paired regions, shape yields quantitative data about which RNA nucleotides are base-paired. Recently, low error rates in secondary structure prediction have been reported for three RNAs of moderate size, by including base stacking pseudo-energy terms derived from shape data into the computation of minimum free energy secondary structure. Here, we describe a novel method, RNAsc (RNA soft constraints), which includes pseudo-energy terms for each nucleotide position, rather than only for base stacking positions. We prove that RNAsc is self-consistent, in the sense that the nucleotide-specific probabilities of being unpaired in the low energy Boltzmann ensemble always become more closely correlated with the input shape data after application of RNAsc. From this mathematical perspective, the secondary structure predicted by RNAsc should be 'correct', in as much as the shape data is 'correct'. We benchmark RNAsc against the previously mentioned method for eight RNAs, for which both shape data and native structures are known, to find the same accuracy in 7 out of 8 cases, and an improvement of 25\% in one case. Furthermore, we present what appears to be the first direct comparison of shape data and in-line probing data, by comparing yeast asp-tRNA shape data from the literature with data from in-line probing experiments we have recently performed. With respect to several criteria, we find that shape data appear to be more robust than in-line probing data, at least in the case of asp-tRNA.},

abstract = {The genus Shewanella has been studied since 1931 with regard to a variety of topics of relevance to both applied and environmental microbiology. Recent years have seen the introduction of a large number of new Shewanella-like isolates, necessitating a coordinated review of the genus. In this work, the phylogenetic relationships among known shewanellae were examined using a battery of morphological, physiological, molecular and chemotaxonomic characterizations. This polyphasic taxonomy takes into account all available phenotypic and genotypic data and integrates them into a consensus classification. Based on information generated from this study and obtained from the literature, a scheme for the identification of Shewanella species has been compiled. Key phenotypic characteristics were sulfur reduction and halophilicity. Fatty acid and quinone profiling were used to impart an additional layer of information. Molecular characterizations employing small-subunit 16S rDNA sequences were at the limits of resolution for the differentiation of species in some cases. As a result, DNA-DNA hybridization and sequence analyses of a more rapidly evolving molecule (gyrB gene) were performed. Species-specific PCR probes were designed for the gyrB gene and used for the rapid screening of closely related strains. With this polyphasic approach, in addition to the ten described Shewanella species, two new species, Shewanella oneidensis and 'Shewanella pealeana', were recognized; Shewanella oneidensis sp. nov. is described here for the first time.},

abstract = {The universally conserved His-66 of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) stacks on the side chain of the esterified Phe of Phe-tRNA(Phe). The affinities of eight aminoacyl-tRNAs were differentially destabilized by the introduction of the H66A mutation into Escherichia coli EF-Tu, whereas Ala-tRNA(Ala) and Gly-tRNA(Gly) were unaffected. The H66F and H66W proteins each show a different pattern of binding of 10 different aminoacyl-tRNAs, clearly showing that this position is critical in establishing the specificity of EF-Tu for different esterified amino acids. However, the H66A mutation does not greatly affect the ability of the ternary complex to bind ribosomes, hydrolyze GTP, or form dipeptide, suggesting that this residue does not directly participate in ribosomal decoding. Selective mutation of His-66 may improve the ability of certain unnatural amino acids to be incorporated by the ribosome.},

abstract = {Quantifying adaptive evolution at the genomic scale is an essential yet challenging aspect of evolutionary biology. Here, we develop a method that extends and generalizes previous approaches to estimate the rate of genomic adaptation in rapidly evolving populations and apply it to a large data set of complete human influenza A virus genome sequences. In accord with previous studies, we observe particularly high rates of adaptive evolution in domain 1 of the viral hemagglutinin (HA1). However, our novel approach also reveals previously unseen adaptation in other viral genes. Notably, we find that the rate of adaptation (per codon per year) is higher in surface residues of the viral neuraminidase than in HA1, indicating strong antibody-mediated selection on the former. We also observed high rates of adaptive evolution in several nonstructural proteins, which may relate to viral evasion of T-cell and innate immune responses. Furthermore, our analysis provides strong quantitative support for the hypothesis that human H1N1 influenza experiences weaker antigenic selection than H3N2. As well as shedding new light on the dynamics and determinants of positive Darwinian selection in influenza viruses, the approach introduced here is applicable to other pathogens for which densely sampled genome sequences are available, and hence is ideally suited to the interpretation of next-generation genome sequencing data.},

Efforts to expand the genetic alphabet, by addition of an unnatural base pair, promise to expand the biotechnological applications available for DNA as well as to be an essential first step toward expansion of the genetic code. We have conducted two independent screens of hydrophobic unnatural nucleotides to identify novel candidate base pairs that are well recognized by a natural DNA polymerase. From a pool of 3600 candidate base pairs, both screens identified the same base pair, dSICS:dMMO2, which we report here. Using a series of related analogues, we performed a detailed structure-activity relationship analysis, which allowed us to identify the essential functional groups on each nucleobase. From the results of these studies, we designed an optimized base pair, d5SICS:dMMO2, which is efficiently and selectively synthesized by Kf within the context of natural DNA.},

@article{Doshi2012,
abstract = {Despite growing evidence suggesting the importance of enzyme conformational dynamics (ECD) in catalysis, a consensus on how precisely ECD influences the chemical step and reaction rates is yet to be reached. Here, we characterize ECD in Cyclophilin A, a well-studied peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, using normal and accelerated, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Kinetics and free energy landscape of the isomerization reaction in solution and enzyme are explored in unconstrained simulations by allowing significantly lower torsional barriers, but in no way compromising the atomistic description of the system or the explicit solvent. We reveal that the reaction dynamics is intricately coupled to enzymatic motions that span multiple timescales and the enzyme modes are selected based on the energy barrier of the chemical step. We show that Kramers' rate theory can be used to present a clear rationale of how ECD affects the reaction dynamics and catalytic rates. The effects of ECD can be incorporated into the effective diffusion coefficient, which we estimate to be about ten times slower in enzyme than in solution. ECD thereby alters the preexponential factor, effectively impeding the rate enhancement. From our analyses, the trend observed for lower torsional barriers can be extrapolated to actual isomerization barriers, allowing successful prediction of the speedup in rates in the presence of CypA, which is in notable agreement with experimental estimates. Our results further reaffirm transition state stabilization as the main effect in enhancing chemical rates and provide a unified view of ECD's role in catalysis from an atomistic perspective.},

Our numbers of E and sigma(70) per cell, which are consistent with most of the primary data in the literature, suggest that in vivo (i) only a minor fraction of RNA polymerase (<20\%) is involved in elongation and (ii) sigma(70) is in excess of total E. Modeling the partitioning of RNA polymerase between promoters, nonspecific DNA binding sites, and the cytoplasm suggested that even weak promoters will be saturated with Esigma(70) in vivo unless nonspecific DNA binding by Esigma(70) is rather significant. In addition, the model predicted that sigmas compete for binding to E only when their total number exceeds the total amount of RNA polymerase (excluding that involved in elongation) and that weak promoters will be preferentially subjected to sigma competition.},

abstract = {Single particle analysis and 3D reconstruction of molecules imaged by transmission electron microscopy have provided a wealth of medium to low resolution structures of biological molecules and macromolecular complexes, such as the ribosome, viruses, molecular chaperones and photosystem II. In this review, the principles of these techniques are introduced in a non-mathematical way, and single particle analysis is compared to other methods used for structural studies. In particular, the recent X-ray structures of the ribosome and of ribosomal subunits allow a critical comparison of single particle analysis and X-ray crystallography. This has emphasised the rapidity with which single particle analysis can produce medium resolution structures of complexes that are difficult to crystallise. Once crystals are available, X-ray crystallography can produce structures at a much higher resolution. The great similarities now seen between the structures obtained by the two techniques reinforce confidence in the use of single particle analysis and 3D reconstruction, and show that for electron cryo-microscopy structure distortion during sample preparation and imaging has not been a significant problem. The ability to analyse conformational flexibility and the ease with which time-resolved studies can be performed are significant advantages for single particle analysis. Future improvements in single particle analysis and electron microscopy should increase the attainable resolution. Combining single particle analysis of macromolecular complexes and electron tomography of subcellular structures with high-resolution X-ray structures may enable us to realise the ultimate dream of structural biology-a complete description of the macromolecular complexes of the cell in their different functional states.},

abstract = {Salt acclimation in moderately halophilic bacteria is the result of action of a grand interplay orchestrated by signals perceived from the environment. To elucidate the cellular players involved in sensing and responding to changing salinities we have determined the genome sequence of Halobacillus halophilus, a Gram-positive moderate halophilic bacterium that has a strict requirement for the anion chloride. Halobacillus halophilus synthesizes a multitude of different compatible solutes and switches its osmolyte strategy with the external salinity and growth phase. Based on the emerging genome sequence, the compatible solutes glutamate, glutamine, proline and ectoine have already been experimentally studied. The biosynthetic routes for acetyl ornithine and acetyl lysine are also delineated from the genome sequence. Halobacillus halophilus is nutritionally very versatile and most compatible solutes cannot only be produced but also used as carbon and energy sources. The genome sequence unravelled isogenes for many pathways indicating a fine regulation of metabolism. Halobacillus halophilus is unique in integrating the concept of compatible solutes with the second fundamental principle to cope with salt stress, the accumulation of molar concentrations of salt (Cl(-)) in the cytoplasm. Extremely halophilic bacteria/archaea, which exclusively rely on the salt-in strategy, have a high percentage of acidic proteins compared with non-halophiles with a low percentage. Halobacillus halophilus has an intermediate position which is consistent with its ability to integrate both principles.},

abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) has been extensively employed for in vivo research since its use was first demonstrated in mammalian cells 10 years ago. Design rules have improved, and it is now routinely possible to obtain reagents that suppress expression of any gene desired. At the same time, increased understanding of the molecular basis of unwanted side effects has led to the development of chemical modification strategies that mitigate these concerns. Delivery remains the single greatest hurdle to widespread adoption of in vivo RNAi methods. However, exciting advances have been made and new delivery systems under development may help to overcome these barriers. This review discusses advances in RNAi biochemistry and biology that impact in vivo use and provides an overview of select publications that demonstrate interesting applications of these principles. Emphasis is placed on work with synthetic, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) published since the first installment of this review which appeared in 2006.},

abstract = {The iterative threading assembly refinement (I-TASSER) server is an integrated platform for automated protein structure and function prediction based on the sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm. Starting from an amino acid sequence, I-TASSER first generates three-dimensional (3D) atomic models from multiple threading alignments and iterative structural assembly simulations. The function of the protein is then inferred by structurally matching the 3D models with other known proteins. The output from a typical server run contains full-length secondary and tertiary structure predictions, and functional annotations on ligand-binding sites, Enzyme Commission numbers and Gene Ontology terms. An estimate of accuracy of the predictions is provided based on the confidence score of the modeling. This protocol provides new insights and guidelines for designing of online server systems for the state-of-the-art protein structure and function predictions. The server is available at http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER.},

@article{Mattick2011,
abstract = {It appears that the genetic programming of humans and other complex organisms has been misunderstood for the past 50 years, due to the assumption that most genetic information is transacted by proteins. However, the human genome contains only about 20,000 protein-coding genes, similar in number and with largely orthologous functions as those in nematodes that have only 1000 somatic cells. By contrast, the extent of non-protein-coding DNA increases with increasing complexity, reaching 98.8\% in humans. The majority of these sequences are dynamically transcribed, mainly into non-protein-coding RNAs, with tens if not hundreds of thousands that show specific expression patterns and subcellular locations, as well as many classes of small regulatory RNAs. The emerging evidence indicates that these RNAs control the epigenetic states that underpin development, and that many are dysregulated in cancer and other complex diseases. Moreover it appears that animals, particularly primates, have evolved plasticity in these RNA regulatory systems, especially in the brain. Thus, it appears that what was dismissed as 'junk' because it was not understood holds the key to understanding human evolution, development, and cognition.},

Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics and data from a phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain DVS 3Y(T) was related to the genus Exiguobacterium. Strain DVS 3Y(T) exhibited >97 \% gene sequence similarity with respect to Exiguobacterium acetylicum DSM 20416(T) (97.4 \%), Exiguobacterium oxidotolerans DSM 17272(T) (97.4 \%), Exiguobacterium indicum IAM 15368(T) (97.6 \%), Exiguobacterium undae DSM 14481(T) (98.2 \%), Exiguobacterium sibiricum DSM 17290(T) (98.6 \%) and Exiguobacterium antarcticum DSM 14480(T) (99.6 \%). However, the levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain DVS 3Y(T) and E. acetylicum DSM 20416(T), E. oxidotolerans JCM 12280(T), E. indicum IAM 15368(T), E. undae DSM 14481(T), E. sibiricum DSM 17290(T) and E. antarcticum DSM 14480(T) were less than 70 \% (52, 25, 16, 33, 16 and 38 \%, respectively). Strain DVS 3Y(T) also differed from these six closely related species in a number of phenotypic traits. Phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data suggest that strain DVS 3Y(T) represents a novel species of the genus Exiguobacterium, for which the name Exiguobacterium soli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is DVS 3Y(T) (=MTCC 4816(T)=JCM 14376(T)).},

abstract = {Explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out for sarcin-ricin domain (SRD) motifs from 23S (Escherichia coli) and 28S (rat) rRNAs. The SRD motif consists of GAGA tetraloop, G-bulged cross-strand A-stack, flexible region and duplex part. Detailed analysis of the overall dynamics, base pairing, hydration, cation binding and other SRD features is presented. The SRD is surprisingly static in multiple 25 ns long simulations and lacks any non-local motions, with root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values between averaged MD and high-resolution X-ray structures of 1-1.4 A. Modest dynamics is observed in the tetraloop, namely, rotation of adenine in its apex and subtle reversible shift of the tetraloop with respect to the adjacent base pair. The deformed flexible region in low-resolution rat X-ray structure is repaired by simulations. The simulations reveal few backbone flips, which do not affect positions of bases and do not indicate a force field imbalance. Non-Watson-Crick base pairs are rigid and mediated by long-residency water molecules while there are several modest cation-binding sites around SRD. In summary, SRD is an unusually stiff rRNA building block. Its intrinsic structural and dynamical signatures seen in simulations are strikingly distinct from other rRNA motifs such as Loop E and Kink-turns.},

abstract = {We have explored the microbial community in a nonpermafrost, cold Alaskan soil using both culture-based and culture-independent approaches. In the present study, we cultured >1000 bacterial isolates from this soil and characterized the collection of isolates phylogenetically and functionally. A screen for antibiosis identified an atypical, red-pigmented strain of Janthinobacterium lividum (strain BR01) that produced prodigiosin when grown at cool temperatures as well as strains (e.g., strain BP01) that are more typical of J. lividium, which produce a purple pigment, violacein. Both purple- and red-pigmented strains exhibited high levels of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. The prodigiosin pathway cloned from J. lividium BR01 was expressed in the heterologous host, Escherichia coli, and the responsible gene cluster differs from that of a well-studied prodigiosin producer, Serratia sp. J. lividum BR01 is the first example of a prodigiosin-producer among the beta-Proteobacteria. The results show that characterization of cultured organisms from previously unexplored environments can expand the current portrait of the microbial world.},

abstract = {The human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax is responsible for 25-40\% of the approximately 515 million annual cases of malaria worldwide. Although seldom fatal, the parasite elicits severe and incapacitating clinical symptoms and often causes relapses months after a primary infection has cleared. Despite its importance as a major human pathogen, P. vivax is little studied because it cannot be propagated continuously in the laboratory except in non-human primates. We sequenced the genome of P. vivax to shed light on its distinctive biological features, and as a means to drive development of new drugs and vaccines. Here we describe the synteny and isochore structure of P. vivax chromosomes, and show that the parasite resembles other malaria parasites in gene content and metabolic potential, but possesses novel gene families and potential alternative invasion pathways not recognized previously. Completion of the P. vivax genome provides the scientific community with a valuable resource that can be used to advance investigation into this neglected species.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Markov models are very popular for analyzing complex sequences such as protein sequences, whose sources are unknown, or whose underlying statistical characteristics are not well understood. A major problem is the computational complexity involved with using Markov models, especially the exponential growth of their size with the order of the model. The probabilistic suffix tree (PST) and its improved variant sparse probabilistic suffix tree (SPST) have been proposed to address some of the key problems with Markov models. The use of the suffix tree, however, implies that the space requirement for the PST/SPST could still be high. RESULTS: We present the probabilistic suffix array (PSA), a data structure for representing information in variable length Markov chains. The PSA essentially encodes information in a Markov model by providing a time and space-efficient alternative to the PST/SPST. Given a sequence of length N, construction and learning in the PSA is done in O(N) time and space, independent of the Markov order. Prediction using the PSA is performed in O(mlog\{N is divided by /$\Sigma$/\}) time, where m is the pattern length, and $\Sigma$ is the symbol alphabet. In terms of modeling and prediction accuracy, using protein families from Pfam 25.0, SPST and PSA produced similar results (SPST 89.82\%, PSA 89.56\%), but slightly lower than HMMER3 (92.55\%). A modified algorithm for PSA prediction improved the performance to 91.7\%, or just 0.79\% from HMMER3 results. The average (maximum) practical construction space for the protein families tested was 21.58±6.32N (41.11N) bytes using the PSA, 27.55±13.16N (63.01N) bytes using SPST and 47±24.95N (140.3N) bytes for HMMER3. The PSA was 255 times faster to construct than the SPST, and 11 times faster than HMMER3.},

abstract = {Four closely related species, Vibrio fischeri, Vibrio logei, Vibrio salmonicida and Vibrio wodanis, form a clade within the family Vibrionaceae; the taxonomic status and phylogenetic position of this clade have remained ambiguous for many years. To resolve this ambiguity, we tested these species against other species of the Vibrionaceae for phylogenetic and phenotypic differences. Sequence identities for the 16S rRNA gene were > or =97.4 \% among members of the V. fischeri group, but were < or =95.5 \% for members of this group in comparison with type species of other genera of the Vibrionaceae (i.e. Photobacterium and Vibrio, with which they overlap in G+C content, and Enterovibrio, Grimontia and Salinivibrio, with which they do not overlap in G+C content). Combined analysis of the recA, rpoA, pyrH, gyrB and 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the species of the V. fischeri group form a tightly clustered clade, distinct from these other genera. Furthermore, phenotypic traits differentiated the V. fischeri group from other genera of the Vibrionaceae, and a panel of 13 biochemical tests discriminated members of the V. fischeri group from type strains of Photobacterium and Vibrio. These results indicate that the four species of the V. fischeri group represent a lineage within the Vibrionaceae that is distinct from other genera. We therefore propose their reclassification in a new genus, Aliivibrio gen. nov. Aliivibrio is composed of four species: Aliivibrio fischeri comb. nov.

abstract = {Ribosomes are molecular machines that translate genetic message into nascent peptides, through a complex dynamics interplay with mRNAs, tRNAs, and various protein factors. A prominent example of ribosomal dynamics is the rota- tion of small ribosomal subunit with respect to a large subunit, characterized as the “ratchet motion,” which is triggered by the binding of several translation factors. Here, we analyze two kinds of ribosomal ratchet motions, induced by the binding of EF-G and RF3, respectively, as previously observed by cryo-electron microscopy. Using the flexible fitting technique (real-space refinement) and an RNA secondary structure display tool (coloRNA), we obtained quasi-atomic models of the ribos- ome in these ratchet-motion-related functional states and mapped the observed dif- ferences onto the highly conserved RNA secondary structure. Comparisons between two sets of ratchet motions revealed that, while the overall patterns of the RNA displacement are very similar, several local regions stand out in their differen- tial behavior, including the highly conserved GAC (GTPase-associated-center) region. We postulate that these regions are important in modulating general ratchet motion and bestowing it with the dynamic characteristics required for the specific function.},

abstract = {The serotonin receptor 2C plays a central role in mood and appetite control. It undergoes pre-mRNA editing as well as alternative splicing. The RNA editing suggests that the pre-mRNA forms a stable secondary structure in vivo. To identify substances that promote alternative exons inclusion, we set up a high-throughput screen and identified pyrvinium pamoate as a drug-promoting exon inclusion without editing. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicates that pyrvinium pamoate binds directly to the pre-mRNA and changes its structure. SHAPE (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension) assays show that part of the regulated 5'-splice site forms intramolecular base pairs that are removed by this structural change, which likely allows splice site recognition and exon inclusion. Genome-wide analyses show that pyrvinium pamoate regulates >300 alternative exons that form secondary structures enriched in A-U base pairs. Our data demonstrate that alternative splicing of structured pre-mRNAs can be regulated by small molecules that directly bind to the RNA, which is reminiscent to an RNA riboswitch.},

Two representatives were isolated from alpine glacier cryoconite and from northern Siberian sediment. Physiological and biochemical properties are similar to characteristics shared by members of the genus Mrakia, although sexual reproduction is absent. Mrakiella cryoconiti strains are psychrophilic and produce cold-active pectate lyase. Sequence analyses of the ITS and 26S rRNA D1/D2 regions indicated that these strains represent a distinct taxon within the Mrakia clade of the order Cystofilobasidiales, class Tremellomycetes and phylum Basidiomycota. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, Cryptococcus aquaticus (a member of the Mrakia clade) is transferred to the newly described genus as Mrakiella aquatica comb. nov.},

A G-deficient rabies virus (RV) pseudotyped with CD4- and CXCR4-derived proteins selectively infected cells expressing HIV-1 envelope protein. Envelope protein or CD4 antibodies blocked virus entry. Pseudotype virus formation was most efficient with chimeric receptor proteins possessing the cytoplasmic tail of the RV G spike protein (CXCR4-RV and CD4-RV). While CXCR4-RV was incorporated when expressed alone, CD4-RV incorporation required CXCR4-RV as a carrier protein, indicating a mechanism by which oligomeric surface proteins are sorted into the RV envelope. Viral vectors bearing virus receptors in their envelope may be useful reagents for targeting virus-infected cells in vivo.},

abstract = {A polyphasic study was undertaken to clarify the taxonomic position of endospore-forming strains 433-D9, 433-E17 and 121-X1. BOX-PCR-generated fingerprints indicated that they may be members of a single species. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity demonstrated that a representative of this group, 433-D9, is affiliated closely with Bacillus arvi DSM 16317(T) (100 \%), Bacillus arenosi DSM 16319(T) (99.8 \%) and Bacillus neidei NRRL BD-87(T) (97.1 \%). Sequence similarities revealed Bacillus pycnus NRRL NRS-1691(T) and several Kurthia species as the next nearest relatives. DNA-DNA hybridization results showed that strain 433-D9 is a member of B. arvi. Detection of l-Lys-d-Asp-based peptidoglycan in strain 433-D9, B. arvi DSM 16317(T) and B. arenosi DSM 16319(T) was in agreement with their close relationship, but differentiated these strains from B. neidei NRRL BD-87(T) and B. pycnus NRRL NRS-1691(T), for which l-Lys-d-Glu was reported. A similar quinone system was detected in strains 433-D9, 433-E17, 121-X1, B. arvi DSM 16317(T), B. arenosi DSM 16319(T) and B. neidei NRRL BD-87(T). This system, unusual for bacilli, consisted of the major compound menaquinone MK-8 (69-80 \%) and moderate amounts of MK-7 (19-30 \%). This observation was in contrast to the predominance of MK-7 of the closest relative B. pycnus NRRL NRS-1691(T), as also reported for representatives of the closely related non-endospore-forming genus Kurthia. Strains 433-D9, B. arvi DSM 16317(T) and B. arenosi DSM 16319(T) exhibited homogeneous and discriminative polar lipid profiles and fatty acid profiles consisting of major acids i-C(15 : 0) and ai-C(15 : 0) and moderate amounts of i-C(17 : 1)omega10c and i-C(17 : 1) I/ai-C(17 : 1) B that discriminated them from closely related strains such as B. neidei NRRL BD-87(T). On the basis of clear-cut discriminative chemotaxonomic markers, we propose strains 433-D9, 433-E17 and 121-X1, B. arvi DSM 16317(T), B. arenosi DSM 16319(T) and B. neidei NRRL BD-87(T) to be reclassified within a separate genus. For this new taxon, we propose the name Viridibacillus gen. nov., and we propose the reclassification of Bacillus arvi, Bacillus arenosi and Bacillus neidei as Viridibacillus arvi gen. nov., comb. nov. (the type species of Viridibacillus, with the type strain DSM 16317(T) =LMG 22165(T)), Viridibacillus arenosi comb. nov. (type strain DSM 16319(T) =LMG 22166(T)) and Viridibacillus neidei comb. nov.

We argue that, with some exceptions, anything less than the release of source programs is intolerable for results that depend on computation. The vagaries of hardware, software and natural language will always ensure that exact reproducibility remains uncertain, but withholding code increases the chances that efforts to reproduce results will fail.},

We have found that although RelE does not degrade free RNA, it cleaves mRNA in the ribosomal A site with high codon specificity. Among stop codons UAG is cleaved with fast, UAA intermediate and UGA slow rate, while UCG and CAG are cleaved most rapidly among sense codons. We suggest that inhibition of protein synthesis by RelE is reversed with the help of tmRNA, and that RelE plays a regulatory role in bacteria during adaptation to poor growth conditions.},

abstract = {A novel strain, designated Gsoil 664(T), isolated from the soil of a ginseng field in South Korea, was characterized by a polyphasic approach to clarify its taxonomic position. The isolate was Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, heterotrophic, non-motile, non-spore-forming and possessed rod-shaped cells. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the novel isolate formed a cluster with several uncultured bacterial clones and with the established genera Terrimonas, Niastella and Chitinophaga in the phylum Bacteroidetes. However, the isolate was clearly separated from these genera: the gene sequence similarities with respect to the type strains of recognized species from closely related genera ranged from 86.7 to 90.7 \%. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 40.4 mol\%. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was MK-7. The major fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH, iso-C(15 : 1) and C(16 : 1) omega 5c. The results of physiological and biochemical tests allowed the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain Gsoil 664(T) from recognized species of related genera. On the basis of the polyphasic evidence, Gsoil 664(T) represents a novel genus and species, for which the name Segetibacter koreensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of S. koreensis is Gsoil 664(T) (=KCTC 12655(T)=DSM 18137(T)).},

abstract = {Determining the structural properties of mRNA is key to understanding vital post-transcriptional processes. As experimental data on mRNA structure are scarce, accurate structure prediction is required to characterize RNA regulatory mechanisms. Although various structure prediction approaches are available, it is often unclear which to choose and how to set their parameters. Furthermore, no standard measure to compare predictions of local structure exists. We assessed the performance of different methods using two types of data: transcriptome-wide enzymatic probing information and a large, curated set of cis-regulatory elements. To compare the approaches, we introduced structure accuracy, a measure that is applicable to both global and local methods. Our results showed that local folding was more accurate than the classic global approach. We investigated how the locality parameters, maximum base pair span and window size, influenced the prediction performance. A span of 150 provided a reasonable balance between maximizing the number of accurately predicted base pairs, while minimizing effects of incorrect long-range predictions. We characterized the error at artificial sequence ends, which we reduced by setting the window size sufficiently greater than the maximum span. Our method, LocalFold, diminished all border effects and produced the most robust performance.},

abstract = {Riboswitches are regulatory RNAs that control downstream gene expression in response to direct association with intracellular metabolites or metals. Typically, riboswitch aptamer domains bind to a single small-molecule metabolite. In contrast, an X-ray crystallographic structural model for the M-box riboswitch aptamer revealed the absence of an organic metabolite ligand but the presence of at least six tightly associated magnesiums. This observation agrees well with the proposed role of the M-box riboswitch in functioning as a sensor of intracellular magnesium, although additional nonspecific metal interactions are also undoubtedly required for these purposes. To gain greater functional insight into the metalloregulatory capabilities of M-box RNAs, we sought to determine whether all or a subset of the RNA-chelated magnesium ions were required for riboswitch function. To accomplish this task, each magnesium-binding site was simultaneously yet individually perturbed through random incorporation of phosphorothioate nucleotide analogues, and RNA molecules were investigated for their ability to fold in varying levels of magnesium. These data revealed that all of the magnesium ions observed in the structural model are important for magnesium-dependent tertiary structure formation. Additionally, these functional data revealed a new core of potential metal-binding sites that are likely to assist formation of key tertiary interactions and were previously unobserved in the structural model. It is clear from these data that M-box RNAs require specific binding of a network of metal ions for partial fulfillment of their metalloregulatory functions.},

Here we show how virus-derived sequences contained in CRISPRs are used by CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins from the host to mediate an antiviral response that counteracts infection. After transcription of the CRISPR, a complex of Cas proteins termed Cascade cleaves a CRISPR RNA precursor in each repeat and retains the cleavage products containing the virus-derived sequence. Assisted by the helicase Cas3, these mature CRISPR RNAs then serve as small guide RNAs that enable Cascade to interfere with virus proliferation. Our results demonstrate that the formation of mature guide RNAs by the CRISPR RNA endonuclease subunit of Cascade is a mechanistic requirement for antiviral defense.},

abstract = {Scaffold proteins link signaling molecules into linear pathways by physically assembling them into complexes. Scaffolds may also have a higher-order role as signal-processing hubs, serving as the target of feedback loops that optimize signaling amplitude and timing. We demonstrate that the Ste5 scaffold protein can be used as a platform to systematically reshape output of the yeast mating MAP kinase pathway. We constructed synthetic positive- and negative-feedback loops by dynamically regulating recruitment of pathway modulators to an artificial binding site on Ste5. These engineered circuits yielded diverse behaviors: ultrasensitive dose response, accelerated or delayed response times, and tunable adaptation. Protein scaffolds provide a flexible platform for reprogramming cellular responses and could be exploited to engineer cells with novel therapeutic and biotechnological functions.},

@article{Ollis2012a,
abstract = {The TonB system of gram-negative bacteria energizes the active transport of diverse nutrients through high-affinity TonB-gated outer membrane transporters using energy derived from the cytoplasmic membrane proton motive force. Cytoplasmic membrane proteins ExbB and ExbD harness the proton gradient to energize TonB, which directly contacts and transmits this energy to ligand-loaded transporters. In Escherichia coli, the periplasmic domain of ExbD appears to transition from proton motive force-independent to proton motive force-dependent interactions with TonB, catalyzing the conformational changes of TonB. A 10-residue deletion scanning analysis showed that while all regions except the extreme amino terminus of ExbD were indispensable for function, distinct roles for the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of the ExbD periplasmic domain were evident. Like residue D25 in the ExbD transmembrane domain, periplasmic residues 42 to 61 facilitated the conformational response of ExbD to proton motive force. This region appears to be important for transmitting signals between the ExbD transmembrane domain and carboxy terminus. The carboxy terminus, encompassing periplasmic residues 62 to 141, was required for initial assembly with the periplasmic domain of TonB, a stage of interaction required for ExbD to transmit its conformational response to proton motive force to TonB. Residues 92 to 121 were important for all three interactions previously observed for formaldehyde-cross-linked ExbD: ExbD homodimers, TonB-ExbD heterodimers, and ExbD-ExbB heterodimers. The distinct requirement of this ExbD region for interaction with ExbB raised the possibility of direct interaction with the few residues of ExbB known to occupy the periplasm.},

abstract = {Both the monophyly and inter-relationships of the major annelid groups have remained uncertain, despite intensive research on both morphology and molecular sequences. Morphological cladistic analyses indicate that Annelida is monophyletic and consists of two monophyletic groups, the clitellates and polychaetes, whereas molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that polychaetes are paraphyletic and that sipunculans are crown-group annelids. Both the monophyly of polychaetes and the placement of sipunculans within annelids are in conflict with the annelid fossil record--the former because Cambrian stem taxa are similar to modern polychaetes in possessing biramous parapodia, suggesting that clitellates are derived from polychaetes; the latter because although fossil sipunculans are known from the Early Cambrian, crown-group annelids do not appear until the latest Cambrian. Here we apply a different data source, the presence versus absence of specific microRNAs--genes that encode approximately 22 nucleotide non-coding regulatory RNAs--to the problem of annelid phylogenetics. We show that annelids are monophyletic with respect to sipunculans, and polychaetes are paraphyletic with respect to the clitellate Lumbricus, conclusions that are consistent with the fossil record. Further, sipunculans resolve as the sister group of the annelids, rooting the annelid tree, and revealing the polarity of the morphological change within this diverse lineage of animals.},

abstract = {Heme-mediated regulation, presented in many biological processes, is achieved in part with proteins containing heme regulatory motif. In this study, we demonstrate that FLAG-tagged PpsR isolated from Rhodobacter sphaeroides cells contains bound heme. In vitro heme binding studies with tagless apo-PpsR show that PpsR binds heme at a near one-to-one ratio with a micromolar binding constant. Mutational and spectral assays suggest that both the second Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) and DNA binding domains of PpsR are involved in the heme binding. Furthermore, we show that heme changes the DNA binding patterns of PpsR and induces different responses of photosystem genes expression. Thus, PpsR functions as both a redox and heme sensor to coordinate the amount of heme, bacteriochlorophyll, and photosystem apoprotein synthesis thereby providing fine tune control to avoid excess free tetrapyrrole accumulation.},

abstract = {The gene encoding the small subunit rRNA serves as a prominent tool for the phylogenetic analysis and classification of Bacteria and Archaea owing to its high degree of conservation and its fundamental function in living organisms. Here we show that the 16S rRNA genes of not-yet-cultivated large sulfur bacteria, among them the largest known bacterium Thiomargarita namibiensis, regularly contain numerous self-splicing introns of variable length. The 16S rRNA genes can thus be enlarged to up to 3.5 kb. Remarkably, introns have never been identified in bacterial 16S rRNA genes before, although they are the most frequently sequenced genes today. This may be caused in part by a bias during the PCR amplification step that discriminates against longer homologs, as we show experimentally. Such length heterogeneity of 16S rRNA genes has so far never been considered when constructing 16S rRNA-based clone libraries, even though an elongation of rRNA genes due to intervening sequences has been reported previously. The detection of elongated 16S rRNA genes has profound implications for common methods in molecular ecology and may cause systematic biases in several techniques. In this study, catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization on both ribosomes and rRNA precursor molecules as well as in vitro splicing experiments were performed and confirmed self-splicing of the introns. Accordingly, the introns do not inhibit the formation of functional ribosomes.},

abstract = {The density of contacts or the fraction of buried sites in a protein structure is thought to be related to a protein's designability, and genes encoding more designable proteins should evolve faster than other genes. Several recent studies have tested this hypothesis but have found conflicting results. Here, we investigate how a gene's evolutionary rate is affected by its protein's contact density, considering the four species Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, and Homo sapiens. We find for all four species that contact density correlates positively with evolutionary rate, and that these correlations do not seem to be confounded by gene expression level. The strength of this signal, however, varies widely among species. We also study the effect of contact density on domain evolution in multidomain proteins and find that a domain's contact density influences the domain's evolutionary rate. Within the same protein, a domain with higher contact density tends to evolve faster than a domain with lower contact density. Our study provides evidence that contact density can increase evolutionary rates, and that it acts similarly on the level of entire proteins and of individual protein domains.},

abstract = {Recent developments in genomics and proteomics provide evidence that yeast and other fungal cell walls share a common origin. The fibrous component of yeast cell walls usually consists of $\beta$- glucan and/or chitin. N-glycosylated proteins form an amorphous, cross-linking matrix as well as fibres on the outer surfaces of the walls. While the enzymes responsible for cross-linking walls into covalent complexes are conserved, the wall-resident proteins have diversified rapidly. These cell wall proteins are usually members of multi-gene families, and paralogues are often subject to gene silencing through epigenetic mechanisms and environmentally induced expression regulation. Comparative studies of protein sequences reveal that there has been fast sequence divergence of the Saccharomyces sexual agglutinins, potentially serving as a driver for yeast speciation. In addition, cell wall proteins show an unusually high content of tandem and non- tandem repeats, and a high frequency of changes in the number of repeats both among paralogues and among orthologues from conspecific strains. The rapid diversification and regulated expression of yeast cell wall proteins help yeast cells to respond to different stimuli and adapt them to diverse biotic and abiotic environments.},

abstract = {During transcription, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) must select the correct nucleotide, catalyze its addition to the growing RNA transcript, and move stepwise along the DNA until a gene is fully transcribed. In all kingdoms of life, transcription must be finely tuned to ensure an appropriate balance between fidelity and speed. Here, we used an optical-trapping assay with high spatiotemporal resolution to probe directly the motion of individual RNAPII molecules as they pass through each of the enzymatic steps of transcript elongation. We report direct evidence that the RNAPII trigger loop, an evolutionarily conserved protein subdomain, serves as a master regulator of transcription, affecting each of the three main phases of elongation, namely: substrate selection, translocation, and catalysis. Global fits to the force-velocity relationships of RNAPII and its trigger loop mutants support a Brownian ratchet model for elongation, where the incoming NTP is able to bind in either the pre- or posttranslocated state, and movement between these two states is governed by the trigger loop. Comparison of the kinetics of pausing by WT and mutant RNAPII under conditions that promote base misincorporation indicate that the trigger loop governs fidelity in substrate selection and mismatch recognition, and thereby controls aspects of both transcriptional accuracy and rate.},

abstract = {Two Shewanella-like bacterial strains, WP2(T) and WP3(T), which were isolated from west Pacific deep-sea sediment, were studied to determine their taxonomic position. Cells of the two bacteria were facultatively anaerobic, Gram-negative rods and motile by means of a single polar flagellum. Strain WP2(T) was psychrophilic, growing optimally at about 10-15 degrees C, whereas strain WP3(T) was psychrotolerant, growing optimally at 15-20 degrees C. The two strains grew in the pressure range 0.1-50 MPa, with optimal growth at 20 MPa. Strain WP3(T) was able to use nitrate, fumarate, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), DMSO and insoluble Fe(III) as terminal electron acceptors during anaerobic growth, whereas strain WP2(T) was able to use only nitrate, TMAO and DMSO. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains WP2(T) and WP3(T) were 97 \% identical, and showed highest similarity (97 \%) to those of Shewanella fidelis KMM 3589 and Shewanella benthica ATCC 43992(T), respectively. The gyrB gene sequences of strains WP2(T)and WP3 (T) were also determined, and showed highest similarity to those of Shewanella violacea JCM 10179(T) (90 \%) and Shewanella sairae SM2-1(T) (87 \%), respectively. Contrary to the 16S rRNA gene sequence results, the phylogeny based on gyrB gene sequence analysis placed strain WP2(T), S. violacea and S. benthica in one group, while strain WP3(T) grouped with S. fidelis and S. sairae. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments supported the placement of strain WP2(T) with S. violacea and S. benthica. Phylogenetic evidence, together with DNA-DNA relatedness and phenotypic characteristics, indicated that the two new strains represented two novel deep-sea Shewanella species.

Based on the potential for microRNA binding sites in a conserved sequence of the Nef-3'-LTR, several host microRNAs potentially could affect HIV-1 gene expression. Among those microRNAs, the microRNA-29 family has seed complementarity in the HIV-1 3'-UTR, but the potential suppressive effect of microRNA-29 on HIV-1 is severely blocked by the secondary structure of the target region.

Among sea ice diatoms, all species examined so far produce ice-binding proteins (IBPs), whereas no such proteins are found in non-ice-associated diatoms, which strongly suggests that IBPs are essential for survival in ice. The restricted occurrence also raises the question of how the IBP genes were acquired. Proteins with similar sequences and ice-binding activities are produced by ice-associated bacteria, and so it has previously been speculated that the genes were acquired by horizontal transfer (HGT) from bacteria. Here we report several new IBP sequences from three types of ice algae, which together with previously determined sequences reveal a phylogeny that is completely incongruent with algal phylogeny, and that can be most easily explained by HGT. HGT is also supported by the finding that the closest matches to the algal IBP genes are all bacterial genes and that the algal IBP genes lack introns. We also describe a highly freeze-tolerant bacterium from the bottom layer of Antarctic sea ice that produces an IBP with 47\% amino acid identity to a diatom IBP from the same layer, demonstrating at least an opportunity for gene transfer. Together, these results suggest that the success of diatoms and other algae in sea ice can be at least partly attributed to their acquisition of prokaryotic IBP genes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Techniques for inferring the functions of the protein by comparing their shape similarity have been receiving a lot of attention. Proteins are functional units and their shape flexibility occupies an essential role in various biological processes. Several shape descriptors have demonstrated the capability of protein shape comparison by treating them as rigid bodies. But this may give rise to an incorrect comparison of flexible protein shapes. RESULTS: We introduce an efficient approach for comparing flexible protein shapes by adapting a local diameter (LD) descriptor. The LD descriptor, developed recently to handle skeleton based shape deformations 1, is adapted in this work to capture the invariant properties of shape deformations caused by the motion of the protein backbone. Every sampled point on the protein surface is assigned a value measuring the diameter of the 3D shape in the neighborhood of that point. The LD descriptor is built in the form of a one dimensional histogram from the distribution of the diameter values. The histogram based shape representation reduces the shape comparison problem of the flexible protein to a simple distance calculation between 1D feature vectors. Experimental results indicate how the LD descriptor accurately treats the protein shape deformation. In addition, we use the LD descriptor for protein shape retrieval and compare it to the effectiveness of conventional shape descriptors. A sensitivity-specificity plot shows that the LD descriptor performs much better than the conventional shape descriptors in terms of consistency over a family of proteins and discernibility across families of different proteins. CONCLUSION: Our study provides an effective technique for comparing the shape of flexible proteins. The experimental results demonstrate the insensitivity of the LD descriptor to protein shape deformation. The proposed method will be potentially useful for molecule retrieval with similar shapes and rapid structure retrieval for proteins.

@article{Kini2009,
abstract = {To enhance silencing and avoid off-target effects, siRNAs are often designed with an intentional bias to ensure that the end of the siRNA that contains the guide strand 5' end is less stably hybridized relative to the end containing the passenger strand 5' end. One means by which this is accomplished is to introduce a terminal mismatch, typically by changing the passenger strand sequence to impair its hybridization with the guide strand 5' end. However, there are conflicting reports about the influence of terminal mismatches on the silencing efficacy of siRNAs. Here, the silencing efficiency of siRNAs with a terminal mismatch generated either by altering the guide strand (at the 5' end, nucleotide 1) or the passenger strand (nucleotide 19 from the 5' end) was examined. Subsequently, we studied the relationship between the silencing efficiency of the siRNAs and their binding to the RNA-induced silencing complex loading complex proteins HIV transactivating response RNA-binding protein and Dicer in H1299 cytoplasmic extracts. Binding of siRNA and the transactivating response RNA-binding protein was significantly reduced by terminal mismatches, which largely agrees with the reduction in eventual silencing efficacy of the siRNAs. Single terminal mismatches led to a small increase in Dicer binding, as expected, but this did not lead to an improvement in silencing activity. These results demonstrate that introduction of mismatches to control siRNA asymmetry may not always improve target silencing, and that care should be taken when designing siRNAs using this technique.},

abstract = {Science progresses faster when researchers operate within an explicit framework of concepts and theories, but currently biology has no explicit, overarching conceptual framework and few general theories. The single general theory currently recognized is that of evolution, which was put forth by Charles Darwin 150 years ago. Recently, Scheiner and Willig (2008) explicated a similarly general theory of ecology. In this paper, using the theory of evolution as an exemplar, I discuss the nature of theory in biology and put forth an overarching theory, as well as new general theories for cells, organisms, and genetics. Along with the theories of evolution and ecology, these constitute a general conceptual framework for the biological sciences. This framework reveals linkages among the various parts of biology, makes explicit the assumptions behind more narrow theories and models, and provides new insights into the structures of biological theories. This framework can also be used as a teaching tool, moving the teaching of biology beyond the transference of a vast compendium of facts. My hope is that this essay will lead to a vigorous discussion and debate across all of biology about the nature and structure of its theories.},

abstract = {We have determined the cell wall composition, guanine-plus-cytosine (G+C) contents of the DNA, rRNA gene restriction patterns, and the levels of DNA-DNA relatedness of 11 strains identified biochemically as Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Corynebacterium group absolute nonfermenter 1 (Corynebacterium group ANF-1). For seven of these strains, growth is abundant on 5\% sheep blood agar, which differentiates them from the four other strains, whose growth requires a lipid supplement such as Tween 80. Two of the lipid-requiring strains produced mucoid colonies on 1\% Tween 80-supplemented sheep blood agar. All strains possess cell wall component type IV, short-chain mycolic acids, and G+C contents of DNA of 66 to 68 mol\% as determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. DNA-relatedness experiments by an S1 nuclease procedure showed that nine of these strains, including two of the lipid-requiring strains, constitute a new genomic species less than 40\% related to Corynebacterium species and other coryneform groups. The lipid-requiring strain T18502 exhibited 98\% DNA relatedness with another lipid-requiring strain, T88593 (difference in thermal denaturation midpoint [delta Tm] = 2 degrees C) and 71 to 77\% similarity with the nonlipophilic strains (delta Tm range of from to 5 degrees C). Conversely, the DNA relatedness between strain LCDC 88199 and the six other nonlipophilic strains ranged from 86 to 100\% (delta Tm range of from 1 to 3 degrees C) and was only 73 and 76\% with the lipophilic strains T18502 and T88593, respectively (delta Tm, 3 and 4 degrees C). These results indicated that these two cultural types of bacteria constitute two subspecies within the new genomic species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Phylogenetic and chemical probing data indicate that a modular RNA motif, common to loop E of eucaryotic 5 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the alpha-sarcin/ricin loop of 23 S rRNA, organizes the structure of multi-helix loops in 16 S and 23 S ribosomal RNAs. The motif occurs in the 3' domain of 16 S rRNA at positions 1345-1350/1372-1376 (Escherichia coli numbering), within the three-way junction loop, which binds ribosomal protein S7, and which contains nucleotides that help to form the binding site for P-site tRNA in the ribosome. The motif also helps to structure a three-way junction within domain I of 23 S, which contains many universally conserved bases and which lies close in the primary and secondary structure to the binding site of r-protein L24. Several other highly conserved hairpin, internal, and multi-helix loops in 16 S and 23 S rRNA contain the motif, including the core junction loop of 23 S and helix 27 in the core of 16 S rRNA. Sequence conservation and range of variation in bacteria, archaea, and eucaryotes as well as chemical probing and cross-linking data, provide support for the recurrent and autonomous existence of the motif in ribosomal RNAs. Besides its presence in the hairpin ribozyme, the loop E motif is also apparent in helix P10 of bacterial RNase P, in domain P7 of one sub-group of group I introns, and in domain 3 of one subgroup of group II introns.},

abstract = {We report a previously undescribed quorum-sensing mechanism for triggering multicellularity in Bacillus subtilis. B. subtilis forms communities of cells known as biofilms in response to an unknown signal. We discovered that biofilm formation is stimulated by a variety of small molecules produced by bacteria--including the B. subtilis nonribosomal peptide surfactin--that share the ability to induce potassium leakage. Natural products that do not cause potassium leakage failed to induce multicellularity. Small-molecule-induced multicellularity was prevented by the addition of potassium, but not sodium or lithium. Evidence is presented that potassium leakage stimulates the activity of a membrane protein kinase, KinC, which governs the expression of genes involved in biofilm formation. We propose that KinC responds to lowered intracellular potassium concentration and that this is a quorum-sensing mechanism that enables B. subtilis to respond to related and unrelated bacteria.},

Cells were motile by means of a polar flagellum. The strains were psychrophilic, growing at -5 to 25 degrees C. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the ice-wedge isolates formed a clade distinct from other genera affiliated with the family Microbacteriaceae. The novel strains showed highest levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with members of the genera Agreia and Subtercola (95.6-95.9 \%). The level of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strains AHU1791(T) and AHU1810 was 99.8 \%. The cell-wall peptidoglycan type of the two strains was B2gamma, containing 2,4-diaminobutyric acid as the diagnostic amino acid. The predominant menaquinones were MK-12 and MK-13 (strain AHU1791(T)) and MK-11 and MK-12 (strain AHU1810). The major fatty acids of the two strains were 12-methyl tetradecanoic acid (anteiso-C(15 : 0)), 14-methyl hexadecanoic acid (anteiso-C(17 : 0)), 14-methyl pentadecanoic acid (iso-C(16 : 0)) and 13-methyl tetradecanoic acid (iso-C(15 : 0)). The DNA G+C contents of strains AHU1791(T) and AHU1810 were approximately 65 mol\%. These phenotypic characteristics differentiated the ice-wedge strains from their closest phylogenetic neighbours, namely Subtercola boreus and the two recognized species of the genus Agreia. The sequences of the housekeeping genes coding for DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB), RNA polymerase subunit B (rpoB) and recombinase A (recA) were almost identical between strains AHU1791(T) and AHU1810. Although the predominant menaquinones found in strains AHU1791(T) and AHU1810 were different, no other distinct differences were found with regard to other phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, indicating that the two strains were members of the same species. Accordingly, strains AHU1791(T) and AHU1810 are considered to represent a single novel species of a new genus, for which the name Glaciibacter superstes gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Glaciibacter superstes is AHU1791(T) (=DSM 21135(T) =NBRC 104264(T)).},

The strains, designated 10a(T), 11c and 12B, can tolerate 5 \% (w/v) NaCl and up to 150 mM boron, but optimal growth was observed without addition of boron or NaCl in Luria-Bertani agar medium. The optimum temperature for growth was 37 degrees C (range 16-45 degrees C) and the optimum pH was 7.0-8.0 (range pH 5.5-9.5). A comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence demonstrated that the isolated strains were closely related to Bacillus fusiformis DSM 2898(T) (97.2 \% similarity) and Bacillus sphaericus DSM 28(T) (96.9 \%). DNA-DNA relatedness was greater than 97 \% among the isolated strains and 61.1 \% with B. fusiformis DSM 2898(T) and 43.2 \% with B. sphaericus IAM 13420(T). The phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses and DNA-DNA relatedness indicated that the three strains belong to the same species, that was characterized by a DNA G+C content of 36.5-37.9 mol\%, MK-7 as the predominant menaquinone system and iso-C(15 : 0) (32 \% of the total) as a major cellular fatty acid. In contrast to the type species of the genus Bacillus, the strains contained peptidoglycan with lysine, aspartic acid, alanine and glutamic acid. Based on the distinctive peptidoglycan composition, phylogenetic analyses and physiology, the strains are assigned to a novel species within a new genus, for which the name Lysinibacillus boronitolerans gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Lysinibacillus boronitolerans is strain 10a(T) (=DSM 17140(T)=IAM 15262(T)=ATCC BAA-1146(T)).

abstract = {RNA tetraloops can recognize receptors to mediate long-range interactions in stable natural RNAs. In vitro selected GNRA tetraloop/receptor interactions are usually more 'G/C-rich' than their 'A/U-rich' natural counterparts. They are not as widespread in nature despite comparable biophysical and chemical properties. Moreover, while AA, AC and GU dinucleotide platforms occur in natural GAAA/11 nt receptors, the AA platform is somewhat preferred to the others. The apparent preference for 'A/U-rich' GNRA/receptor interactions in nature might stem from an evolutionary adaptation to avoid folding traps at the level of the larger molecular context. To provide evidences in favor of this hypothesis, several riboswitches based on natural and artificial GNRA receptors were investigated in vitro for their ability to prevent inter-molecular GNRA/receptor interactions by trapping the receptor sequence into an alternative intra-molecular pseudoknot. Extent of attenuation determined by native gel-shift assays and co-transcriptional assembly is correlated to the G/C content of the GNRA receptor. Our results shed light on the structural evolution of natural long-range interactions and provide design principles for RNA-based attenuator devices to be used in synthetic biology and RNA nanobiotechnology.},

@article{Shyu2008,
abstract = {Quality control of gene expression operates post-transcriptionally at various levels in eukaryotes. Once transcribed, mRNAs associate with a host of proteins throughout their lifetime. These mRNA-protein complexes (mRNPs) undergo a series of remodeling events that are influenced by and/or influence the translation and mRNA decay machinery. In this review we discuss how a decision to translate or to degrade a cytoplasmic mRNA is reached. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and microRNA (miRNA)-mediated mRNA silencing are provided as examples. NMD is a surveillance mechanism that detects and eliminates aberrant mRNAs whose expression would result in truncated proteins that are often deleterious to the organism. miRNA-mediated mRNA silencing is a mechanism that ensures a given protein is expressed at a proper level to permit normal cellular function. While NMD and miRNA-mediated mRNA silencing use different decision-making processes to determine the fate of their targets, both are greatly influenced by mRNP dynamics. In addition, both are linked to RNA processing bodies. Possible modes involving 3' untranslated region and its associated factors, which appear to play key roles in both processes, are discussed.},

We developed a general approach for assembling RNA devices that can execute higher-order cellular information processing operations from standard components. The engineered devices can function as logic gates (AND, NOR, NAND, or OR gates) and signal filters, and exhibit cooperativity.

abstract = {Microorganisms play pivotal functions in the trophic dynamics and biogeochemistry of aquatic ecosystems. Their concentrations and activities often peak at localized hotspots, an important example of which are pycnoclines, where water density increases sharply with depth due to gradients in temperature or salinity. At pycnoclines organisms are exposed to different environmental conditions compared to the bulk water column, including reduced turbulence, slow mass transfer, and high particle and predator concentrations. Here we show that, at an even more fundamental level, the density stratification itself can affect microbial ecology at pycnoclines, by quenching the flow signature, increasing the energetic expenditure, and stifling the nutrient uptake of motile organisms. We demonstrate this through numerical simulations of an archetypal low-Reynolds-number swimmer, the "squirmer." We identify the Richardson number-the ratio of buoyancy forces to viscous forces-as the fundamental parameter that quantifies the effects of stratification. These results demonstrate an unexpected effect of buoyancy on low-Reynolds-number swimming, potentially affecting a broad range of abundant organisms living at pycnoclines in oceans and lakes.},

Recent work has shown that Tetrahymena has many classes of small RNA molecules expressed during vegetative growth or sexual reorganization. In order to get an overview of medium-sized (40-500 nt) RNAs expressed from the Tetrahymena genome, we created a size-fractionated cDNA library from macronuclear RNA and analyzed 80 RNAs, most of which were previously unknown. The most abundant class was small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), many of which are formed by an unusual maturation pathway. The modifications guided by the snoRNAs were analyzed bioinformatically and experimentally and many Tetrahymena-specific modifications were found, including several in an essential, but not conserved domain of ribosomal RNA. Of particular interest, we detected two methylations in the 5'-end of U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) that has an unusual structure in Tetrahymena. Further, we found a candidate for the first U8 outside metazoans, and an unusual U14 candidate. In addition, a number of candidates for new non-coding RNAs were characterized by expression analysis at different growth conditions.},

abstract = {Synthetic biology has advanced the design of standardized control devices that program cellular functions and metabolic activities in living organisms. Rational interconnection of these synthetic switches resulted in increasingly complex designer networks that execute input-triggered genetic instructions with precision, robustness and computational logic reminiscent of electronic circuits. Using trigger-controlled transcription factors, which independently control gene expression, and RNA-binding proteins that inhibit the translation of transcripts harbouring specific RNA target motifs, we have designed a set of synthetic transcription–translation control devices that could be rewired in a plug-and-play manner. Here we show that these combinatorial circuits integrated a two-molecule input and performed digital computations with NOT, AND, NAND and N-IMPLY expression logic in single mammalian cells. Functional interconnection of two N-IMPLY variants resulted in bitwise intracellular XOR operations, and a combinatorial arrangement of three logic gates enabled independent cells to perform programmable half-subtractor and half-adder calculations. Individual mammalian cells capable of executing basic molecular arithmetic functions isolated or coordinated to metabolic activities in a predictable, precise and robust manner may provide new treatment strategies and bio-electronic interfaces in future gene-based and cell-based therapies.},

abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22-nucleotide noncoding RNA regulatory genes that are key players in cellular differentiation and homeostasis. They might also play important roles in shaping metazoan macroevolution. Previous studies have shown that miRNAs are continuously being added to metazoan genomes through time, and, once integrated into gene regulatory networks, show only rare mutations within the primary sequence of the mature gene product and are only rarely secondarily lost. However, because the conclusions from these studies were largely based on phylogenetic conservation of miRNAs between model systems like Drosophila and the taxon of interest, it was unclear if these trends would describe most miRNAs in most metazoan taxa. Here, we describe the shared complement of miRNAs among 18 animal species using a combination of 454 sequencing of small RNA libraries with genomic searches. We show that the evolutionary trends elucidated from the model systems are generally true for all miRNA families and metazoan taxa explored: the continuous addition of miRNA families with only rare substitutions to the mature sequence, and only rare instances of secondary loss. Despite this conservation, we document evolutionary stable shifts to the determination of position 1 of the mature sequence, a phenomenon we call seed shifting, as well as the ability to post-transcriptionally edit the 5' end of the mature read, changing the identity of the seed sequence and possibly the repertoire of downstream targets. Finally, we describe a novel type of miRNA in demosponges that, although shows a different pre-miRNA structure, still shows remarkable conservation of the mature sequence in the two sponge species analyzed. We propose that miRNAs might be excellent phylogenetic markers, and suggest that the advent of morphological complexity might have its roots in miRNA innovation.},

The bacteria were Gram-negative, flexirubin-negative, aerobic, catalase-positive and oxidase-negative and were psychrophilic and halophilic. All strains utilized D-fructose, L-fucose and alpha-ketobutyric acid and degraded alginic acid, carrageenan, starch and autoclaved yeast cells. Amplification with primers specific for repetitive extragenic palindromic elements by PCR divided the strains of this study into two groups.

Data on bacteriophages in polar inland waters are scant but the indications are that they play an active and dynamic role in these microbially dominated polar ecosystems. This review summarises what is presently known about polar inland bacteriophages, ranging from subglacial Antarctic lakes to glacial ecosystems in the Arctic. The review examines interactions between bacteriophages and their hosts and the abiotic and biotic variables that influence these interactions in polar inland waters. In addition, we consider the proportion of the bacteria in Arctic and Antarctic lake and glacial waters that are lysogenic and visibly infected with viruses. We assess the relevance of bacteriophages in the microbial loop in the extreme environments of Antarctic and Arctic inland waters with an emphasis on carbon cycling.},

abstract = {Many cold habitats contain plenty of microorganisms that represent the most abundant cold-adapted life forms on earth. These organisms have developed a wide range of adaptations that involve the cell wall of the microorganism. In particular, bacteria enhance the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids of membrane lipids to maintain the membrane fluidity, but very little is known about the adaptational changes in the structure of the lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), the main constituent of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the chemical structure of these LPSs for insight into the temperature-adaptation mechanism. For this objective, the cold-adapted Psychromonas arctica bacterium, which lives in the arctic sea-water near Spitzbergen (Svalbard islands, Arctic) was cultivated at 4 degrees C. The lipooligosaccharides (LOSs) were isolated and analysed by means of chemical analysis and electrospray ionisation high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry. The LOS was then degraded either by mild hydrazinolysis (O-deacylation) or with hot 4 M KOH (N-deacylation). Both products were investigated in detail by using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The core consists of a mixture of species that differ because of the presence of nonstoichiometric D-fructose and/or D-galacturonic acid units.},

abstract = {Analysis of the Haloarcula marismortui large ribosomal subunit has revealed a common RNA structure that we call the kink-turn, or K-turn. The six K-turns in H.marismortui 23S rRNA superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 1.7 A. There are two K-turns in the structure of Thermus thermophilus 16S rRNA, and the structures of U4 snRNA and L30e mRNA fragments form K-turns. The structure has a kink in the phosphodiester backbone that causes a sharp turn in the RNA helix. Its asymmetric internal loop is flanked by C-G base pairs on one side and sheared G-A base pairs on the other, with an A-minor interaction between these two helical stems. A derived consensus secondary structure for the K-turn includes 10 consensus nucleotides out of 15, and predicts its presence in the 5'-UTR of L10 mRNA, helix 78 in Escherichia coli 23S rRNA and human RNase MRP. Five K-turns in 23S rRNA interact with nine proteins. While the observed K-turns interact with proteins of unrelated structures in different ways, they interact with L7Ae and two homologous proteins in the same way.},

The ultimate goal of automatically producing RNA three-dimensional models from given secondary and tertiary structure data, however, is still not fully realized. Recent developments in the computational prediction of RNA structure have helped bridge the gap between RNA secondary structure prediction, including pseudoknots, and three-dimensional modeling of RNA.},

abstract = {Originally discovered in the bacteriophage Mu DNA inversion system gin, Fis (Factor for Inversion Stimulation) regulates many genetic systems. To determine the base frequency conservation required for Fis to locate its binding sites, we collected a set of 60 experimentally defined wild-type Fis DNA binding sequences. The sequence logo for Fis binding sites showed the significance and likely kinds of base contacts, and these are consistent with available experimental data. Scanning with an information theory based weight matrix within fis, nrd, tgt/sec and gin revealed Fis sites not previously identified, but for which there are published footprinting and biochemical data. DNA mobility shift experiments showed that a site predicted to be 11 bases from the proximal Salmonella typhimurium hin site and a site predicted to be 7 bases from the proximal P1 cin site are bound by Fis in vitro. Two predicted sites separated by 11 bp found within the nrd promoter region, and one in the tgt/sec promoter, were also confirmed by gel shift analysis. A sequence in aldB previously reported to be a Fis site, for which information theory predicts no site, did not shift. These results demonstrate that information analysis is useful for predicting Fis DNA binding.},

All of the 16S, 23S, and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) chains, the A-, P-, and E-site tRNAs, and most of the ribosomal proteins can be fitted to the electron density map. The core of the interface between the 30S small subunit and the 50S large subunit, where the tRNA substrates are bound, is dominated by RNA, with proteins located mainly at the periphery, consistent with ribosomal function being based on rRNA. In each of the three tRNA binding sites, the ribosome contacts all of the major elements of tRNA, providing an explanation for the conservation of tRNA structure. The tRNAs are closely juxtaposed with the intersubunit bridges, in a way that suggests coupling of the 20 to 50 angstrom movements associated with tRNA translocation with intersubunit movement.},

abstract = {The recently discovered ubiquity of the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae in headwaters and alpine ecosystems worldwide elicits new questions about the ecology of this bacterium and subsequent consequences for disease epidemiology. Because of the major contribution of snow to river run-off during crop growth, we evaluated the population dynamics of P. syringae in snowpack and the underlying leaf litter during two years in the Southern French Alps. High population densities of P. syringae were found on alpine grasses, and leaf litter was identified as the main source of populations of P. syringae in snowpack, contributing more than the populations arriving with the snowfall. The insulating properties of snow foster survival of P. syringae throughout the winter in the 10 cm layer of snow closest to the soil. Litter and snowpack harboured populations of P. syringae that were very diverse in terms of phenotypes and genotypes. Neither substrate nor sampling site had a marked effect on the structure of P. syringae populations, and snow and litter had genotypes in common with other non-agricultural habitats and with crops. These results contribute to the mounting evidence that a highly diverse P. syringae metapopulation is disseminated throughout drainage basins between cultivated and non-cultivated zones.},

Ecdysozoan phylogeny and Bayesian inference: first use of nearly complete 28S and 18S rRNA gene sequences to classify the arthropods and their kin. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 31, 178-191] that evaluated the phylogenetic relationships in Ecdysozoa (molting animals), especially arthropods. Here, the number of rRNA gene-sequences was effectively doubled for each major group of arthropods, and sequences from the phylum Kinorhyncha (mud dragons) were also included, bringing the number of ecdysozoan taxa to over 80. The methods emphasized maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference and statistical testing with parametric bootstrapping, but also included parsimony and minimum evolution. Prominent findings from our combined analysis of both genes are as follows. The fundamental subdivisions of Hexapoda (insects and relatives) are Insecta and Entognatha, with the latter consisting of collembolans (springtails) and a clade of proturans plus diplurans. Our rRNA-gene data provide the strongest evidence to date that the sister group of Hexapoda is Branchiopoda (fairy shrimps, tadpole shrimps, etc.), not Malacostraca. The large, Pancrustacea clade (hexapods within a paraphyletic Crustacea) divided into a few basic subclades: hexapods plus branchiopods; cirripedes (barnacles) plus malacostracans (lobsters, crabs, true shrimps, isopods, etc.); and the basally located clades of (a) ostracods (seed shrimps) and (b) branchiurans (fish lice) plus the bizarre pentastomids (tongue worms). These findings about Pancrustacea agree with a recent study by Regier, Shultz, and Kambic that used entirely different genes [Regier, J.C., Shultz, J.W., Kambic, R.E., 2005a. Pancrustacean phylogeny: hexapods are terrestrial crustaceans and maxillopods are not monophyletic. Proc. R. Soc. B 272, 395-401]. In Malacostraca, the stomatopod (mantis shrimp) was not at the base of the eumalacostracans, as is widely claimed, but grouped instead with an euphausiacean (krill). Within centipedes, Craterostigmus was the sister to all other pleurostigmophorans, contrary to the consensus view. Our trees also united myriapods (millipedes and centipedes) with chelicerates (horseshoe crabs, spiders, scorpions, and relatives) and united pycnogonids (sea spiders) with chelicerates, but with much less support than in the previous rRNA-gene study. Finally, kinorhynchs joined priapulans (penis worms) at the base of Ecdysozoa.},

@article{Chursov2013,
abstract = {Recent reports indicate that mutations in viral genomes tend to preserve RNA secondary structure, and those mutations that disrupt secondary structural elements may reduce gene expression levels, thereby serving as a functional knockout. In this article, we explore the conservation of secondary structures of mRNA coding regions, a previously unknown factor in bacterial evolution, by comparing the structural consequences of mutations in essential and nonessential Escherichia coli genes accumulated over 40 000 generations in the course of the 'long-term evolution experiment'. We monitored the extent to which mutations influence minimum free energy (MFE) values, assuming that a substantial change in MFE is indicative of structural perturbation. Our principal finding is that purifying selection tends to eliminate those mutations in essential genes that lead to greater changes of MFE values and, therefore, may be more disruptive for the corresponding mRNA secondary structures. This effect implies that synonymous mutations disrupting mRNA secondary structures may directly affect the fitness of the organism. These results demonstrate that the need to maintain intact mRNA structures imposes additional evolutionary constraints on bacterial genomes, which go beyond preservation of structure and function of the encoded proteins.},

These sequence 'walkers' can be stepped along raw sequence data to visually search for binding sites. Many walkers, for the same or different proteins, can be simultaneously placed next to a sequence to create a quantitative map of a complex genetic region. One can alter the sequence to quantitatively engineer binding sites. Database anomalies can be visualized by placing a walker at the recorded positions of a binding molecule and by comparing this to locations found by scanning the nearby sequences. The sequence can also be altered to predict whether a change is a polymorphism or a mutation for the recognizer being modeled.},

abstract = {The assembly of virus capsids or other spherical polymers--empty, closed structures composed of hundreds of protein subunits--is poorly understood. Assembly of a closed spherical polymer is unlike polymerization of a filament or crystal, examples of open-ended polymers. This must be considered to develop physically meaningful analyses. We have developed a model of capsid assembly, based on a cascade of low-order reactions, that allows us to calculate kinetic simulations. The behavior of this model resembles assembly kinetics observed in solution (Zlotnick, A., J. M. Johnson, P. W. Wingfield, S. J. Stahl, and D. Endres. 1999. Biochemistry. 38:14644-14652). We exhibit two examples of this general model describing assembly of dodecahedral and icosahedral capsids. Using simulations based on these examples, we demonstrate how to extract robust estimates of assembly parameters from accessible experimental data. These parameters, nucleus size, average nucleation rate, and average free energy of association can be determined from measurement of subunit and capsid as time and concentration vary. Mathematical derivations of the analyses, carried out for a general model, are provided in an Appendix. The understanding of capsid assembly developed in this paper is general; the examples provided can be readily modified to reflect different biological systems. This enhanced understanding of virus assembly will allow a more quantitative analysis of virus stability and biological or antiviral factors that affect assembly.},

Non-Watson-Crick base pairs also play crucial roles in tertiary contacts in structured RNA molecules. We previously classified RNA base pairs geometrically so as to group together those base pairs that are structurally similar (isosteric) and therefore able to substitute for each other by mutation without disrupting the 3D structure. Here, we introduce a quantitative measure of base pair isostericity, the IsoDiscrepancy Index (IDI), to more accurately determine which base pair substitutions can potentially occur in conserved motifs. We extract and classify base pairs from a reduced-redundancy set of RNA 3D structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and calculate centroids (exemplars) for each base combination and geometric base pair type (family). We use the exemplars and IDI values to update our online Basepair Catalog and the Isostericity Matrices (IM) for each base pair family. From the database of base pairs observed in 3D structures we derive base pair occurrence frequencies for each of the 12 geometric base pair families. In order to improve the statistics from the 3D structures, we also derive base pair occurrence frequencies from rRNA sequence alignments.},

abstract = {Two species of novel, chemolithoautotrophic, sulfidogenic micro-organisms were isolated from submarine hydrothermal systems in the Atlantic (at the Kolbeinsey Ridge north of Iceland) and in the Pacific (at 9 degrees N, 104 degrees W). The coccoid cells grew within a temperature range of 70-98 degrees C (optimum around 90 degrees C). They gained energy by reduction of elemental sulfur using molecular hydrogen as the electron donor. 165 rDNA-based sequence comparisons revealed that the organisms are members of the crenarchaeal branch of the Archaea. They represent a new, deeply branching lineage within the family of the Desulfurococcaceae. In DNA-DNA hybridization experiments both strains exhibited low levels of hybridization to each other and to further representatives of this family. Therefore, they represent a new genus, for which the name Ignicoccus gen. nov. is proposed. At present it consists of two new species, Ignicoccus islandicus sp. nov. (type strain is Kol8T = DSM 13165T = ATCC 700957T) and Ignicoccus pacificus sp. nov. (type strain is LPC33T = DSM 13166T = ATCC 700958T).},

abstract = {RNA junctions are important structural elements that form when three or more helices come together in space in the tertiary structures of RNA molecules. Determining their structural configuration is important for predicting RNA 3D structure. We introduce a computational method to predict, at the secondary structure level, the coaxial helical stacking arrangement in junctions, as well as classify the junction topology. Our approach uses a data mining approach known as random forests, which relies on a set of decision trees trained using length, sequence and other variables specified for any given junction. The resulting protocol predicts coaxial stacking within three- and four-way junctions with an accuracy of 81\% and 77\%, respectively; the accuracy increases to 83\% and 87\%, respectively, when knowledge from the junction family type is included. Coaxial stacking predictions for the five to ten-way junctions are less accurate (60\%) due to sparse data available for training. Additionally, our application predicts the junction family with an accuracy of 85\% for three-way junctions and 74\% for four-way junctions. Comparisons with other methods, as well applications to unsolved RNAs, are also presented. The web server Junction-Explorer to predict junction topologies is freely available at: http://bioinformatics.njit.edu/junction.},

abstract = {The Escherichia coli chromosomal relBE operon encodes a toxin-antitoxin system, which is autoregulated by its protein products, RelB and RelE. RelB acts as a transcriptional repressor and RelE functions as a cofactor to enhance the repressor activity of RelB. Here, we present the NMR-derived structure of a RelB dimer and show that a RelB dimer recognizes a hexad repeat in the palindromic operator region through a ribbon-helix-helix motif. Our biochemical data show that two weakly associated RelB dimers bind to the adjacent repeats in the 3'-site of the operator (O(R)) at a moderate affinity (K(d), approximately 10(-5) M). However, in the presence of RelE, a RelB tetramer binds two distinct binding sites within the operator region, each with an enhanced affinity (K(d), approximately 10(-6) M for the low-affinity site, O(L), and 10(-8) M for the high-affinity site, O(R)). We propose that the enhanced affinity for the operator element is mediated by a cooperative DNA binding by a pair of RelB dimers and that the interaction between RelB dimers is strongly augmented by the presence of the cognate toxin RelE.},

abstract = {Kink-turn (K-turn) motifs are asymmetric internal loops found at conserved positions in diverse RNAs, with sharp bends in phosphodiester backbones producing V-shaped structures. Explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for three K-turns from 23S rRNA, i.e., Kt-38 located at the base of the A-site finger, Kt-42 located at the base of the L7/L12 stalk, and Kt-58 located in domain III, and for the K-turn of human U4 snRNA. The simulations reveal hinge-like K-turn motions on the nanosecond timescale. The first conserved A-minor interaction between the K-turn stems is entirely stable in all simulations. The angle between the helical arms of Kt-38 and Kt-42 is regulated by local variations of the second A-minor (type I) interaction between the stems. Its variability ranges from closed geometries to open ones stabilized by insertion of long-residency waters between adenine and cytosine. The simulated A-minor geometries fully agree with x-ray data. Kt-58 and Kt-U4 exhibit similar elbow-like motions caused by conformational change of the adenosine from the nominally unpaired region. Despite the observed substantial dynamics of K-turns, key tertiary interactions are stable and no sign of unfolding is seen. We suggest that some K-turns are flexible elements mediating large-scale ribosomal motions during the protein synthesis cycle.},

@article{Butcher2011,
abstract = {RNA molecules adopt specific three-dimensional structures critical to their function. Many essential metabolic processes, including protein synthesis and RNA splicing, are carried out by RNA molecules with elaborate tertiary structures (e.g. 3QIQ, right). Indeed, the ribosome and self-splicing introns are complex RNA machines. But even the coding regions in messenger RNAs and viral RNAs are flanked by highly structured untranslated regions, which provide regulatory information necessary for gene expression. RNA tertiary structure is defined as the three-dimensional arrangement of RNA building blocks, which include helical duplexes, triple-stranded structures, and other components that are held together through connections collectively termed RNA tertiary interactions. The structural diversity of these interactions is now a subject of intense investigation, involving the techniques of NMR, X-ray crystallography, chemical genetics, and phylogenetic analysis. At the same time, many investigators are using biophysical techniques to elucidate the driving forces for tertiary structure formation and the mechanisms for its stabilization. RNA tertiary folding is promoted by maximization of base stacking, much like the hydrophobic effect that drives protein folding. RNA folding also requires electrostatic stabilization, both through charge screening and site binding of metals, and it is enhanced by desolvation of the phosphate backbone. In this Account, we provide an overview of the features that specify and stabilize RNA tertiary structure. A major determinant for overall tertiary RNA architecture is local conformation in secondary-structure junctions, which are regions from which two or more duplexes project. At junctions and other structures, such as pseudoknots and kissing loops, adjacent helices stack on one another, and these coaxial stacks play a major role in dictating the overall architectural form of an RNA molecule. In addition to RNA junction topology, a second determinant for RNA tertiary structure is the formation of sequence-specific interactions. Networks of triple helices, tetraloop-receptor interactions, and other sequence-specific contacts establish the framework for the overall tertiary fold. The third determinant of tertiary structure is the formation of stabilizing stacking and backbone interactions, and many are not sequence specific. For example, ribose zippers allow 2'-hydroxyl groups on different RNA strands to form networks of interdigitated hydrogen bonds, serving to seal strands together and thereby stabilize adjacent substructures. These motifs often require monovalent and divalent cations, which can interact diffusely or through chelation to specific RNA functional groups. As we learn more about the components of RNA tertiary structure, we will be able to predict the structures of RNA molecules from their sequences, thereby obtaining key information about biological function. Understanding and predicting RNA structure is particularly important given the recent discovery that although most of our genome is transcribed into RNA molecules, few of them have a known function. The prevalence of RNA viruses and pathogens with RNA genomes makes RNA drug discovery an active area of research. Finally, knowledge of RNA structure will facilitate the engineering of supramolecular RNA structures, which can be used as nanomechanical components for new materials. But all of this promise depends on a better understanding of the RNA parts list, and how the pieces fit together.},

abstract = {According to the Red Queen hypothesis or arms race dynamics, coevolution drives continuous adaptation and counter-adaptation. Experimental models under simplified environments consisting of bacteria and bacteriophages have been used to analyze the ongoing process of coevolution, but the analysis of both parasites and their hosts in ongoing adaptation and counter-adaptation remained to be performed at the levels of population dynamics and molecular evolution to understand how the phenotypes and genotypes of coevolving parasite-host pairs change through the arms race. Copropagation experiments with Escherichia coli and the lytic RNA bacteriophage Q$\beta$ in a spatially unstructured environment revealed coexistence for 54 days (equivalent to 163-165 replication generations of Q$\beta$) and fitness analysis indicated that they were in an arms race. E. coli first adapted by developing partial resistance to infection and later increasing specific growth rate. The phage counter-adapted by improving release efficiency with a change in host specificity and decrease in virulence. Whole-genome analysis indicated that the phage accumulated 7.5 mutations, mainly in the A2 gene, 3.4-fold faster than in Q$\beta$ propagated alone. E. coli showed fixation of two mutations (in traQ and csdA) faster than in sole E. coli experimental evolution. These observations suggest that the virus and its host can coexist in an evolutionary arms race, despite a difference in genome mutability (i.e., mutations per genome per replication) of approximately one to three orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {In nature, the complexity and structure of microbial communities varies widely, ranging from a few species to thousands of species, and from highly structured to highly unstructured communities. Here, we describe the identity and functional capacity of microbial populations within distinct layers of a pristine, marine-derived, meromictic (stratified) lake (Ace Lake) in Antarctica. Nine million open reading frames were analyzed, representing microbial samples taken from six depths of the lake size fractionated on sequential 3.0, 0.8 and 0.1 $\mu$m filters, and including metaproteome data from matching 0.1 $\mu$m filters. We determine how the interactions of members of this highly structured and moderately complex community define the biogeochemical fluxes throughout the entire lake. Our view is that the health of this delicate ecosystem is dictated by the effects of the polar light cycle on the dominant role of green sulfur bacteria in primary production and nutrient cycling, and the influence of viruses/phage and phage resistance on the cooperation between members of the microbial community right throughout the lake. To test our assertions, and develop a framework applicable to other microbially driven ecosystems, we developed a mathematical model that describes how cooperation within a microbial system is impacted by periodic fluctuations in environmental parameters on key populations of microorganisms. Our study reveals a mutualistic structure within the microbial community throughout the lake that has arisen as the result of mechanistic interactions between the physico-chemical parameters and the selection of individual members of the community. By exhaustively describing and modelling interactions in Ace Lake, we have developed an approach that may be applicable to learning how environmental perturbations affect the microbial dynamics in more complex aquatic systems.},

abstract = {How does a cell respond to numerous external stresses with a limited number of internal molecular components? It has been observed that there are some common responses of yeast to various stresses, but most observations were based on gene-expression profiles and only some part of the common responses were intensively investigated. So far there has been no system-level analysis to identify commonly responsive or regulated genes against various stresses. In this study, we identified a core regulation module (CRM), a commonly involved regulation structure in the regulatory networks of yeast, which cells reuse in response to an array of environmental stresses. We found that regulators in the CRM constitute a hierarchical backbone of the yeast regulatory network and that the CRM is evolutionarily well conserved, stable against genetic variations and crucial for cell growth. All these findings were consistently held up to considerable noise levels that we introduced to address experimental noise and the resulting false positives of regulatory interactions. We conclude that the CRM of yeast might be an evolutionarily conserved information processing unit that endows a cell with enhanced robustness and efficiency in dealing with numerous environmental stresses with a limited number of internal elements.},

abstract = {Antarctic ecosystems are fascinating in their limited trophic complexity, with decomposition and nutrient cycling functions being dominated by microbial activities. Not only are Antarctic habitats exposed to extreme environmental conditions, the Antarctic Peninsula is also experiencing unequalled effects of global warming. Owing to their uniqueness and the potential impact of global warming on these pristine systems, there is considerable interest in determining the structure and function of microbial communities in the Antarctic. We therefore utilized a recently designed 16S rRNA gene microarray, the PhyloChip, which targets 8741 bacterial and archaeal taxa, to interrogate microbial communities inhabiting densely vegetated and bare fell-field soils along a latitudinal gradient ranging from 51 degrees S (Falkland Islands) to 72 degrees S (Coal Nunatak). Results indicated a clear decrease in diversity with increasing latitude, with the two southernmost sites harboring the most distinct Bacterial and Archaeal communities. The microarray approach proved more sensitive in detecting the breadth of microbial diversity than polymerase chain reaction-based bacterial 16S rRNA gene libraries of modest size ( approximately 190 clones per library). Furthermore, the relative signal intensities summed for phyla and families on the PhyloChip were significantly correlated with the relative occurrence of these taxa in clone libraries. PhyloChip data were also compared with functional gene microarray data obtained earlier, highlighting numerous significant relationships and providing evidence for a strong link between community composition and functional gene distribution in Antarctic soils. Integration of these PhyloChip data with other complementary methods provides an unprecedented understanding of the microbial diversity and community structure of terrestrial Antarctic habitats.},

abstract = {We took advantage of the unusual genomic organization of the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax to screen for eukaryotic non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes. Ciliates have two types of nuclei: a germ line micronucleus that is usually transcriptionally inactive, and a somatic macronucleus that contains a reduced, fragmented and rearranged genome that expresses all genes required for growth and asexual reproduction. In some ciliates including Oxytricha, the macronuclear genome is particularly extreme, consisting of thousands of tiny 'nanochromosomes', each of which usually contains only a single gene. Because the organism itself identifies and isolates most of its genes on single-gene nanochromosomes, nanochromosome structure could facilitate the discovery of unusual genes or gene classes, such as ncRNA genes. Using a draft Oxytricha genome assembly and a custom-written protein-coding genefinding program, we identified a subset of nanochromosomes that lack any detectable protein-coding gene, thereby strongly enriching for nanochromosomes that carry ncRNA genes. We found only a small proportion of non-coding nanochromosomes, suggesting that Oxytricha has few independent ncRNA genes besides homologs of already known RNAs. Other than new members of known ncRNA classes including C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs, our screen identified one new family of small RNA genes, named the Arisong RNAs, which share some of the features of small nuclear RNAs.},

abstract = {An improved dynamic programming algorithm is reported for RNA secondary structure prediction by free energy minimization. Thermodynamic parameters for the stabilities of secondary structure motifs are revised to include expanded sequence dependence as revealed by recent experiments. Additional algorithmic improvements include reduced search time and storage for multibranch loop free energies and improved imposition of folding constraints. An extended database of 151,503 nt in 955 structures? determined by comparative sequence analysis was assembled to allow optimization of parameters not based on experiments and to test the accuracy of the algorithm. On average, the predicted lowest free energy structure contains 73 \% of known base-pairs when domains of fewer than 700 nt are folded; this compares with 64 \% accuracy for previous versions of the algorithm and parameters. For a given sequence, a set of 750 generated structures contains one structure that, on average, has 86 \% of known base-pairs. Experimental constraints, derived from enzymatic and flavin mononucleotide cleavage, improve the accuracy of structure predictions.},

abstract = {Network motifs are statistically overrepresented sub-structures (sub-graphs) in a network, and have been recognized as 'the simple building blocks of complex networks'. Study of biological network motifs may reveal answers to many important biological questions. The main difficulty in detecting larger network motifs in biological networks lies in the facts that the number of possible sub-graphs increases exponentially with the network or motif size (node counts, in general), and that no known polynomial-time algorithm exists in deciding if two graphs are topologically equivalent. This article discusses the biological significance of network motifs, the motivation behind solving the motif-finding problem, and strategies to solve the various aspects of this problem. A simple classification scheme is designed to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of several existing algorithms. Experimental results derived from a few comparative studies in the literature are discussed, with conclusions that lead to future research directions.},

Here, we show that recombinant human Dicer alone can bind 21-nt ssRNAs in vitro, independent of their sequence and structure. We also demonstrate that Dicer binds ssRNAs having a 5'-phosphate with greater affinity versus those with a 5'-hydroxyl. In addition, 3'-biotinylated ssRNAs are bound by Dicer with lower affinity than 3'-hydroxyl ssRNAs. The stability of ssRNA-Dicer complexes was found to depend on divalent cations. Together, our results suggest a role for the PAZ domain of Dicer in binding ssRNAs and may indicate roles for Dicer in cellular function beyond those currently known.},

abstract = {Three Gram-positive bacterial strains, 7-3, 255-15 and 190-11, previously isolated from Siberian permafrost, were characterized and taxonomically classified. These microorganisms are rod-shaped, facultative aerobic, motile with peritrichous flagella and their growth ranges are from -2.5 to 40 degrees C. The chemotaxonomic markers indicated that the three strains belong to the genus Exiguobacterium. Their peptidoglycan type was A3alpha L-Lys-Gly. The predominant menaquinone detected in all three strains was MK7. The polar lipids present were phosphatidyl-glycerol, diphosphatidyl-glycerol and phosphatidyl-ethanolamine. The major fatty acids were iso-C13:0, anteiso-C13:0, iso-C15:0, C16:0 and iso-C17:0. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA and six diverse genes, gyrB (gyrase subunit B), rpoB (DNA-directed RNA polymerase beta subunit), recA (homologous recombination), csp (cold shock protein), hsp70 (ClassI-heat shock protein-chaperonin) and citC (isocitrate dehydrogenase), indicated that the strains were closely related to Exiguobacterium undae (DSM 14481(T)) and Exiguobacterium antarcticum (DSM 14480(T)). On the basis of the phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic data and DNA-DNA reassociation data, strain 190-11 was classified as E. undae, while the other two isolates, 7-3 and 255-15, comprise a novel species, for which the name Exiguobacterium sibiricum sp. nov. is proposed.},

abstract = {Regulation of gene expression involves formation of specific protein-DNA complexes in which the DNA is often bent or sharply kinked. Kinetics measurements of DNA bending when in complex with the protein are essential for understanding the molecular mechanism that leads to precise recognition of specific DNA-binding sites. Previous kinetics measurements on several DNA-bending proteins used stopped-flow techniques that have limited time resolution of few milliseconds. Here we use a nanosecond laser temperature-jump apparatus to probe, with submillisecond time resolution, the kinetics of bending/unbending of a DNA substrate bound to integration host factor (IHF), an architectural protein from Escherichia coli. The kinetics are monitored with time-resolved FRET, with the DNA substrates end-labeled with a FRET pair. The temperature-jump measurements, in combination with stopped-flow measurements, demonstrate that the binding of IHF to its cognate DNA site involves an intermediate state with straight or, possibly, partially bent DNA. The DNA bending rates range from approximately 2 ms(-1) at approximately 37 degrees C to approximately 40 ms(-1) at approximately 10 degrees C and correspond to an activation energy of approximately 14 +/- 3 kcal/mol. These rates and activation energy are similar to those of a single A:T base pair opening inside duplex DNA. Thus, our results suggest that spontaneous thermal disruption in base-paring, nucleated at an A:T site, may be sufficient to overcome the free energy barrier needed to partially bend/kink DNA before forming a tight complex with IHF.},

A de Bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (k-mers) that is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25-50 bp) data sets. Applying Velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb N50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb N50 on simulated mammalian BACs. When applied to real Solexa data sets without read pairs, Velvet generated contigs of approximately 8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian BAC, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information. Velvet represents a new approach to assembly that can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.},

abstract = {Sequences of the 16S rDNA from all available type strains of Chromatium species have been determined and were compared to those of other Chromatiaceae, a few selected Ectothiorhodospiraceae and Escherichia coli. The clear separation of Ectothiorhodospiraceae and Chromatiaceae is confirmed. Most significantly the sequence comparison revealed a genetic divergence between Chromatium species originated from freshwater sources and those of truly marine and halophilic nature. Major phylogenetic branches of the Chromatiaceae contain (i) marine and halophilic species, (ii) freshwater Chromatium species together with Thiocystis species and (iii) species of the genera Thiocapsa and Amoebobacter as recently reclassified [Guyoneaud, R. \& 6 other authors (1988). Int J Syst Bacteriol 48, 957-964], namely Thiocapsa roseopersicina, Thiocapsa pendens (formerly Amoebobacter pendens), Thiocapsa rosea (formerly Amoebobacter roseus), Amoebobacter purpureus and Thiolamprovum pedioforme (formerly Amoebobacter pedioformis). The genetic relationships between the species and groups are not in congruence with the current classification of the Chromatiaceae and a reclassification is proposed on the basis of 16S rDNA sequence similarity supported by selected phenotypic properties. The proposed changes include the transfers of Chromatium minus and Chromatium violascens to Thiocystis minor comb. nov. and Thiocystis violascens comb. nov., of Chromatium vinosum, Chromatium minutissimum and Chromatium warmingii to the new genus Allochromatium as Allochromatium vinosum comb. nov., Allochromatium minutissimum comb. nov., and Allochromatium warmingii comb. nov., of Chromatium tepidum to the new genus Thermochromatium as Thermochromatium tepidum comb. nov., of Chromatium salexigens and Chromatium glycolicum to the new genus Halochromatium as Halochromatium salexigens comb. nov. and Halochromatium glycolicum comb. nov., of Chromatium gracile and Chromatium purpuratum to the new genus as Marichromatium gracile comb. nov. and Marichromatium purpuratum comb. nov., of Thiocapsa pfennigii to Thiococcus pfennigii gen. nom. rev., of Thiocapsa halophila to the new genus Thiohalocapsa as Thiohalocapsa halophila comb. nov., and of Chromatium buderi to the new genus Isochromatium as Isochromatium buderi comb. nov.},

abstract = {This article is a tutorial for PDBj Mine, a new database and its interface for Protein Data Bank Japan (PDBj). In PDBj Mine, data are loaded from files in the PDBMLplus format (an extension of PDBML, PDB's canonical XML format, enriched with annotations), which are then served for the user of PDBj via the worldwide web (WWW). We describe the basic design of the relational database (RDB) and web interfaces of PDBj Mine. The contents of PDBMLplus files are first broken into XPath entities, and these paths and data are indexed in the way that reflects the hierarchical structure of the XML files. The data for each XPath type are saved into the corresponding relational table that is named as the XPath itself. The generation of table definitions from the PDBMLplus XML schema is fully automated. For efficient search, frequently queried terms are compiled into a brief summary table. Casual users can perform simple keyword search, and 'Advanced Search' which can specify various conditions on the entries. More experienced users can query the database using SQL statements which can be constructed in a uniform manner. Thus, PDBj Mine achieves a combination of the flexibility of XML documents and the robustness of the RDB. Database URL: http://www.pdbj.org/},

abstract = {The relationship between information and energy is key to understanding biological systems. We can display the information in DNA sequences specifically bound by proteins by using sequence logos, and we can measure the corresponding binding energy. These can be compared by noting that one of the forms of the second law of thermodynamics defines the minimum energy dissipation required to gain one bit of information. Under the isothermal conditions that molecular machines function this is [Formula in text] joules per bit (kB is Boltzmann's constant and T is the absolute temperature). Then an efficiency of binding can be computed by dividing the information in a logo by the free energy of binding after it has been converted to bits. The isothermal efficiencies of not only genetic control systems, but also visual pigments are near 70\%. From information and coding theory, the theoretical efficiency limit for bistate molecular machines is ln 2=0.6931. Evolutionary convergence to maximum efficiency is limited by the constraint that molecular states must be distinct from each other. The result indicates that natural molecular machines operate close to their information processing maximum (the channel capacity), and implies that nanotechnology can attain this goal.},

abstract = {The affinity between molecules depends both on the nature and presentation of the contacts. Here, we observe coupling of functional and structural elements when a protein binding domain is evolved to a smaller functional mimic. Previously, a 38-residue form of the 59-residue B-domain of protein A, termed Z38, was selected by phage display. Z38 contains 13 mutations and binds IgG only 10-fold weaker than the native B-domain. We present the solution structure of Z38 and show that it adopts a tertiary structure remarkably similar to that observed for the first two helices of B-domain in the B-domain/Fc complex [Deisenhofer, J. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 2361-2370], although it is significantly less stable. Based on this structure, we have improved on Z38 by designing a 34-residue disulfide-bonded variant (Z34C) that has dramatically enhanced stability and binds IgG with 9-fold higher affinity. The improved stability of Z34C led to NMR spectra with much greater chemical shift dispersion, resulting in a more precisely determined structure. Z34C, like Z38, has a structure virtually identical to the equivalent region from native protein A domains. The well-defined hydrophobic core of Z34C reveals key structural features that have evolved in this small, functional domain. Thus, the stabilized two-helix peptide, about half the size and having one-third of the remaining residues altered, accurately mimics both the structure and function of the native domain.},

abstract = {Single-nucleotide-resolution chemical mapping for structured RNA is being rapidly advanced by new chemistries, faster readouts, and coupling to computational algorithms. Recent tests have shown that selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation by primer extension (SHAPE) can give near-zero error rates (0-2\%) in modeling the helices of RNA secondary structure. Here, we benchmark the method using six molecules for which crystallographic data are available: tRNA(phe) and 5S rRNA from Escherichia coli, the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena group I ribozyme, and ligand-bound domains from riboswitches for adenine, cyclic di-GMP, and glycine. SHAPE-directed modeling of these highly structured RNAs gave an overall false negative rate (FNR) of 17\% and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 21\%, with at least one helix prediction error in five of the six cases. Extensive variations of data processing, normalization, and modeling parameters did not significantly mitigate modeling errors. Only one varation, filtering out data collected with deoxyinosine triphosphate during primer extension, gave a modest improvement (FNR = 12\%, and FDR = 14\%). The residual structure modeling errors are explained by the insufficient information content of these RNAs' SHAPE data, as evaluated by a nonparametric bootstrapping analysis. Beyond these benchmark cases, bootstrapping suggests a low level of confidence (<50\%) in the majority of helices in a previously proposed SHAPE-directed model for the HIV-1 RNA genome. Thus, SHAPE-directed RNA modeling is not always unambiguous, and helix-by-helix confidence estimates, as described herein, may be critical for interpreting results from this powerful methodology.},

@article{Chahine2007,
abstract = {We show that diffusion can play an important role in protein-folding kinetics. We explicitly calculate the diffusion coefficient of protein folding in a lattice model. We found that diffusion typically is configuration- or reaction coordinate-dependent. The diffusion coefficient is found to be decreasing with respect to the progression of folding toward the native state, which is caused by the collapse to a compact state constraining the configurational space for exploration. The configuration- or position-dependent diffusion coefficient has a significant contribution to the kinetics in addition to the thermodynamic free-energy barrier. It effectively changes (increases in this case) the kinetic barrier height as well as the position of the corresponding transition state and therefore modifies the folding kinetic rates as well as the kinetic routes. The resulting folding time, by considering both kinetic diffusion and the thermodynamic folding free-energy profile, thus is slower than the estimation from the thermodynamic free-energy barrier with constant diffusion but is consistent with the results from kinetic simulations. The configuration- or coordinate-dependent diffusion is especially important with respect to fast folding, when there is a small or no free-energy barrier and kinetics is controlled by diffusion. Including the configurational dependence will challenge the transition state theory of protein folding. The classical transition state theory will have to be modified to be consistent. The more detailed folding mechanistic studies involving phi value analysis based on the classical transition state theory also will have to be modified quantitatively.},

abstract = {Fundamental control over supra-molecular self-assembly for organization of matter on the nano-scale is a major objective of nanoscience and nanotechnology. 'RNA tectonics' is the design of modular RNA units, called tectoRNAs, that can be programmed to self-assemble into novel nano- and meso-scopic architectures of desired size and shape. We report the three-dimensional design of tectoRNAs incorporating modular 4-way junction (4WJ) motifs, hairpin loops and their cognate loop-receptors to create extended, programmable interaction interfaces. Specific and directional RNA-RNA interactions at these interfaces enable conformational, topological and orientational control of tectoRNA self-assembly. The interacting motifs are precisely positioned within the helical arms of the 4WJ to program assembly from only one helical stacking conformation of the 4WJ. TectoRNAs programmed to assemble with orientational compensation produce micrometer-scale RNA filaments through supra-molecular equilibrium polymerization. As visualized by transmission electron microscopy, these RNA filaments resemble actin filaments from the protein world. This work emphasizes the potential of RNA as a scaffold for designing and engineering new controllable biomaterials mimicking modern cytoskeletal proteins.},

The G+C contents of the isolates were in the range 38-39 mol\%. The major respiratory quinone was MK-7. The predominant cellular fatty acids were 20 : 4omega6c (arachidonic acid), 16 : 0 and iso-17 : 0. On the basis of morphological, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, together with DNA-DNA hybridization data and 16S rRNA gene sequences, the isolates represent a novel species of a novel genus, for which the name Aureispira marina gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed.

abstract = {Transcription is a sophisticated multi-step process in which RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribes a DNA template into RNA in concert with a broad array of transcription initiation, elongation, capping, termination, and histone modifying factors. Recent global analyses of Pol II distribution have indicated that many genes are regulated during the elongation phase, shedding light on a previously underappreciated mechanism for controlling gene expression. Understanding how various factors regulate transcription elongation in living cells has been greatly aided by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies, which can provide spatial and temporal resolution of protein-DNA binding events. The coupling of ChIP with DNA microarray and high-throughput sequencing technologies (ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq) has significantly increased the scope of ChIP studies and genome-wide maps of Pol II or elongation factor binding sites can now be readily produced. However, while ChIP-chip/ChIP-seq data allow for high-resolution localization of protein-DNA binding sites, they are not sufficient to dissect protein function. Here we describe techniques for coupling ChIP-chip/ChIP-seq with genetic, chemical, and experimental manipulation to obtain mechanistic insight from genome-wide protein-DNA binding studies. We have employed these techniques to discern immature promoter-proximal Pol II from productively elongating Pol II, and infer a critical role for the transition between initiation and full elongation competence in regulating development and gene induction in response to environmental signals.},

Records showed discrete steps averaging 3.7 ± 0.6 \AA, a distance equivalent to the mean rise per base found in B-DNA. By combining our results with quantitative gel analysis, we conclude that RNAP advances along DNA by a single base pair per nucleotide addition to the nascent RNA. We also determined the force–velocity relationship for transcription at both saturating and subsaturating nucleotide concentrations; fits to these data returned a characteristic distance parameter equivalent to one base pair. Global fits were inconsistent with a model for movement incorporating a power stroke tightly coupled to pyrophosphate release, but consistent with a brownian ratchet model incorporating a secondary NTP binding site.

This program enables multiple-dimensions of information about RNA structure to be selected, customized and displayed to visually identify patterns and relationships.

The bacterial flagellum is a primary example of a complex apparatus whose origins and evolutionary history have proven difficult to reconstruct. The gene clusters encoding the components of the flagellum can include >50 genes, but these clusters vary greatly in their numbers and contents among bacterial phyla. To investigate how this diversity arose, we identified all homologs of all flagellar proteins encoded in the complete genome sequences of 41 flagellated species from 11 bacterial phyla. Based on the phylogenetic occurrence and histories of each of these proteins, we could distinguish an ancient core set of 24 structural genes that were present in the common ancestor to all Bacteria. Within a genome, many of these core genes show sequence similarity only to other flagellar core genes, indicating that they were derived from one another, and the relationships among these genes suggest the probable order in which the structural components of the bacterial flagellum arose. These results show that core components of the bacterial flagellum originated through the successive duplication and modification of a few, or perhaps even a single, precursor gene.},

abstract = {How could the incredible complexity of modern cells evolve from something simple enough to have appeared in a primordial soup? This enduring question has sparked the interest of researchers since Darwin first considered his theory of natural selection. Organic molecules, even potentially functional molecules including peptides and nucleotides, can be produced abiotically. Amphiphiles such as surfactants and lipids display remarkable self-assembly processes including the spontaneous formation of vesicles resembling the membranes of living cells. Nonetheless, numerous questions remain. Given the presumably dilute concentrations of macromolecules in the prebiotic pools where the earliest cells are thought to have appeared, how could the necessary components become concentrated and encapsulated within a semipermeable membrane? What would drive the further structural complexity that is a hallmark of modern living systems? The interior of modern cells is subdivided into microcompartments such as the nucleoid of bacteria or the organelles of eukaryotic cells. Even within what at first appears to be a single compartment, for example, the cytoplasm or nucleus, chemical composition is often nonuniform, containing gradients, macromolecular assemblies, and/or liquid droplets. What might the internal structure of intermediate evolutionary forms have looked like? The nonideal aqueous solution chemistry of macromolecules offers an attractive possible answer to these questions. Aqueous polymer solutions will form multiple coexisting thermodynamic phases under a variety of readily accessible conditions. In this Account, we describe aqueous phase separation as a model system for biological compartmentalization in both early and modern cells, with an emphasis on systems that have been encapsulated within a lipid bilayer. We begin with an introduction to aqueous phase separation and discuss how this phenomenon can lead to microcompartmentalization and could facilitate biopolymer encapsulation by partitioning of solutes between the phases. We then describe primitive model cells based on phase separation inside lipid vesicles, which mimic several basic properties of biological cells: microcompartmentation, protein relocalization in response to stimulus, loss of symmetry, and asymmetric vesicle division. We observe these seemingly complex phenomena in the absence of genetic molecules, enzymes, or cellular machinery, and as a result these processes could provide clues to possible intermediates in the early evolution of cell-like assemblies.},

The lack of early viral samples with clinical information made it difficult to investigate the possible virological changes over time. In this study, we sequenced 142 full-length env genes collected from 16 Japanese subjects infected with HIV-1 in the 1980s and in the 2000s. We examined the diversity change in sequences and potential adaptive evolution of the virus to the host population. We used a codon-based likelihood method under the branch-site and clade models to detect positive selection operating on the virus. The clade model was extended to account for different positive selection pressures in different viral populations. The result showed that the selection pressure was weaker in the 2000s than in the 1980s, indicating that it might have become easier for the HIV to infect a new host and to develop into AIDS now than 20 years ago and that the HIV may be becoming more virulent in the Japanese population. The study provides useful information on the surveillance of HIV infection and highlights the utility of the extended clade models in analysis of virus populations which may be under different selection pressures.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of RNA-protein complex between Escherichia coli loop E/helix IV (LE/HeIV) rRNA and L25 protein reveal a qualitative agreement between the experimental and simulated structures. The major groove of LE is a prominent rRNA cation-binding site. Divalent cations rigidify the LE major groove geometry whereas in the absence of divalent cations LE extensively interacts with monovalent cations via inner-shell binding. The HeIV region shows bistability of its major groove explaining the observed differences between x-ray and NMR structures. In agreement with the experiments, the simulations suggest that helix-alpha1 of L25 is the least stable part of the protein. Inclusion of Mg2+ cations into the simulations causes perturbation of basepairing at the LE/HeIV junction, which does not, however, affect the protein binding. The rRNA-protein complex is mediated by a number of highly specific hydration sites with long-residing water molecules and two of them are bound throughout the entire 24-ns simulation. Long-residing water molecules are seen also outside the RNA-protein contact areas with water-binding times substantially enhanced compared to simulations of free RNA.

abstract = {A novel biosensing approach for the label-free detection of nucleic acid sequences of short and large lengths has been implemented, with special emphasis on targeting RNA sequences with secondary structures. The approach is based on selecting 8-aminoadenine-modified parallel-stranded DNA tail-clamps as affinity bioreceptors. These receptors have the ability of creating a stable triplex-stranded helix at neutral pH upon hybridization with the nucleic acid target. A surface plasmon resonance biosensor has been used for the detection. With this strategy, we have detected short DNA sequences (32-mer) and purified RNA (103-mer) at the femtomol level in a few minutes in an easy and level-free way. This approach is particularly suitable for the detection of RNA molecules with predicted secondary structures, reaching a limit of detection of 50 fmol without any label or amplification steps. Our methodology has shown a marked enhancement for the detection (18\% for short DNA and 54\% for RNA), when compared with the conventional duplex approach, highlighting the large difficulty of the duplex approach to detect nucleic acid sequences, especially those exhibiting stable secondary structures. We believe that our strategy could be of great interest to the RNA field.},

abstract = {Both intra- and interspecific interactions between microbes are likely to play an important role in determining the severity of microbial infections. Here, we study the impact of interactions between coinfecting opportunistic pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on both phenotypic and genetic changes in a P. aeruginosa social trait, the production of iron-scavenging siderophores. Siderophores are facultatively upregulated in response to iron limitation and play a key role in determining the virulence of microbial infections. Siderophore production is metabolically expensive to individual producers but benefits the group as a whole because siderophores can be used by all cells in the vicinity with siderophore receptors. Hence, populations of siderophore producers can be invaded by nonproducing cheats. Previous work has shown that P. aeruginosa can lyse S. aureus, supplying a source of free iron. We therefore hypothesized that the presence of S. aureus might result in facultative downregulation of siderophore production, and in turn, reduced selection for siderophore cheats. We tested this hypothesis by evolving P. aeruginosa in the presence and absence of free iron and S. aureus, in a fully factorial design. Iron had the expected effect: siderophore production was downregulated and cheats evolved less readily, but the presence of S. aureus instead increased facultative siderophore production and selection for cheats. This is probably because the S. aureus had the net effect of competing for iron, rather than acting as an iron source. This study demonstrates that interspecific competition can have a marked effect on intraspecific social interactions.},

abstract = {The discoveries of microRNAs and riboswitches, among others, have shown functional RNAs to be biologically more important and genomically more prevalent than previously anticipated. We have developed a general comparative genomics method based on phylogenetic stochastic context-free grammars for identifying functional RNAs encoded in the human genome and used it to survey an eight-way genome-wide alignment of the human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, zebra-fish, and puffer-fish genomes for deeply conserved functional RNAs. At a loose threshold for acceptance, this search resulted in a set of 48,479 candidate RNA structures. This screen finds a large number of known functional RNAs, including 195 miRNAs, 62 histone 3'UTR stem loops, and various types of known genetic recoding elements. Among the highest-scoring new predictions are 169 new miRNA candidates, as well as new candidate selenocysteine insertion sites, RNA editing hairpins, RNAs involved in transcript auto regulation, and many folds that form singletons or small functional RNA families of completely unknown function. While the rate of false positives in the overall set is difficult to estimate and is likely to be substantial, the results nevertheless provide evidence for many new human functional RNAs and present specific predictions to facilitate their further characterization.},

abstract = {In this study biodegradation of hydrocarbons in thin oil films was investigated in seawater at low temperatures, 0 and 5 degrees C. Heterotrophic (HM) or oil-degrading (ODM) microorganisms enriched at the two temperatures showed 16S rRNA sequence similarities to several bacteria of Arctic or Antarctic origin. Biodegradation experiments were conducted with a crude mineral oil immobilized as thin films on hydrophobic Fluortex adsorbents in nutrient-enriched or sterile seawater. Chemical and respirometric analysis of hydrocarbon depletion showed that naphthalene and other small aromatic hydrocarbons (HCs) were primarily biodegraded after dissolution to the water phase, while biodegradation of larger polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and C(10)-C(36) n-alkanes, including n-hexadecane, was associated primarily with the oil films. Biodegradation of PAH and n-alkanes was significant at both 0 and 5 degrees C, but was decreased for several compounds at the lower temperature. n-Hexadecane biodegradation at the two temperatures was comparable at the end of the experiments, but was delayed at 0 degree C. Investigations of bacterial communities in seawater and on adsorbents by PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments and DGGE analysis indicated that predominant bacteria in the seawater gradually adhered to the oil-coated adsorbents during biodegradation at both temperatures. Sequence analysis of most DGGE bands aligned to members of the phyla Proteobacteria (Gammaproteobacteria) or Bacteroidetes. Most sequences from experiments at 0 degree C revealed affiliations to members of Arctic or Antarctic consortia, while no such homology was detected for sequences from degradation experiment run at 5 degrees C. In conclusion, marine microbial communities from cold seawater have potentials for oil film HC degradation at temperatures < or =5 degrees C, and psychrotrophic or psychrophilic bacteria may play an important role during oil HC biodegradation in seawater close to freezing point.},

abstract = {Bacterial interference refers to the antagonism between bacterial species during the process of surface colonisation and acquisition of nutrients. The clinical evidence on the potential applications of microorganisms for the prevention and/or treatment of infections in the upper respiratory, urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts was reviewed through the PubMed and Scopus databases. Data regarding factors that may affect the human microflora, thus contributing to tissue colonisation from potential pathogens, were also retrieved. The clinical evidence for application of the interfering ability of non-virulent bacteria to prevent or treat infections has been rather limited, although promising for certain purposes. A number of relevant preliminary trials suggest that in the upper respiratory tract the rate of recurrence of otitis media or streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis appears to decrease using selected bacteria with inhibitory ability against common pathogens of upper respiratory tract in combination with appropriate antibiotic treatment. Regarding the urogenital tract, specific non-pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and probiotic organisms were successfully applied to decrease the recurrence of local infections. The interfering ability of specific probiotic organisms (strains of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria) within the gastrointestinal tract against common pathogens was also demonstrated. In conclusion, randomised controlled trials are warranted to investigate the effectiveness and safety of potential applications of the principle of bacterial interference in the prevention and treatment of infections of various sites. Such trials should initially employ selected strains of probiotics for which there are preliminary data regarding their effectiveness and lack of common or serious toxicity.},

abstract = {Persister cells are dormant phenotypic variants inherent in a bacterial population. They play important roles in chronic infections and present great challenges to therapy due to extremely enhanced tolerance to antibiotics compared to that of normal cells of the same genotype. In this study, we report that cationic membrane-penetrating peptides containing various numbers of arginine and tryptophan repeats are effective in killing persister cells of Escherichia coli HM22, a hyper-persister producer. The activities of three linear peptides [(RW)(n)-NH(2), where n is 2, 3, or 4] and a dendrimeric peptide, (RW)(4D), in killing bacterial persisters were compared. Although the dendrimeric peptide (RW)(4D) requires a lower threshold to kill planktonic persisters, octameric peptide (RW)(4)-NH(2) is the most effective against planktonic persister cells at high concentrations. For example, treatment with 80 $\mu$M (RW)(4)-NH(2) for 60 min led to a 99.7\% reduction in the number of viable persister cells. The viability of persister cells residing in surface-attached biofilms was also significantly reduced by (RW)(4)-NH(2) and (RW)(4D). These two peptides were also found to significantly enhance the susceptibility of biofilm cells to ofloxacin. The potency of (RW)(4)-NH(2) was further marked by its ability to disperse and kill preformed biofilms harboring high percentages of persister cells. Interestingly, approximately 70\% of the dispersed cells were found to have lost their intrinsic tolerance and become susceptible to ampicillin if not killed directly by this peptide. These results are helpful for better understanding the activities of these peptides and may aid in future development of more effective therapies of chronic infections.},

Fecal indicator bacteria were widespread in California beach sand, with Escherichia coli and enterococci detected at 68\% and 94\% of the beaches surveyed, respectively. Somatic coliphages and a Bacteroidales human-specific fecal marker were detected at 43\% and 13\% of the beaches, respectively. Dry sand samples from almost 30\% of the beaches contained at least one of the following pathogens: Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which were detected at 15\%, 13\%, 14\%, and 3\% of tested beaches, respectively. Fecal indicators and pathogens were poorly correlated to one another and to land cover. Sands were dry at the time of collection, and those with relatively high moisture tended to have higher concentrations or a more frequent occurrence of both indicators and pathogens. Using culture-dependent assays, fecal indicators decayed faster than pathogens in microcosm experiments using unaltered beach sand seeded with sewage and assessed by culture-dependent assays. The following order of persistence was observed (listed from most to least persistent): Campylobacter > Salmonella > somatic coliphages > enterococci > E. coli > F(+) phages. In contrast, pathogens decayed faster than fecal indicators in culture-independent assays: enterococci > Bacteroidales human-specific marker > Salmonella > Campylobacter. Microcosm experiments demonstrated that both indicators and pathogens were mobilized by wetting with seawater. Decay rates measured by QPCR were lower than those measured with culture-dependent methods. Enterococcal persistence and possible growth were observed for wetted microcosms relative to unwetted controls.},

Strain 170(T) contained C(16 : 1)omega7c, C(16 : 0), C(12 : 1) 3-OH and C(18 : 1)omega7c as major fatty acids. The genomic DNA G+C content was 42.9 mol\%. On the basis of phenotypic characterization, phylogenetic analysis and DNA-DNA relatedness data, strain 170(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Glaciecola, for which the name Glaciecola psychrophila is proposed. The type strain is 170(T) (=CGMCC 1.6130(T)=JCM 13954(T)).},

Such alignments also underlie many genome-evolution studies. Here we review recent computational advances in the area of multi-sequence alignment, focusing on methods suitable for aligning whole vertebrate genomes. We introduce the key algorithmic ideas in use today, and identify publicly available resources for computing, accessing, and visualizing genomic alignments. Finally, we describe the latest alignment-based approaches to identify and characterize various types of functional sequences. Key areas of research are identified and directions for future improvements are suggested.},

Although numerous RNA motifs have been classified and characterized, the identification of new motifs is of great interest. In this study, we discovered four new conformationally recurring motifs: the pi-turn, the Omega-turn, the alpha-loop and the C2'-endo mediated flipped adenosine motif. Not only do they have complex and interesting structures, but they participate in contacts of high biological significance. In a first for the RNA field, new motifs were discovered by a fully automated algorithm. This algorithm, COMPADRES, utilized a reduced representation of the RNA backbone and was highly successful at discerning unique structural relationships. This study also shows that recurring RNA substructures are not necessarily accompanied by consistent primary or secondary structure.},

Due to their repetitive structure and highly active transcription, the rRNA gene repeats are some of the most fragile sites in the chromosome. A unique gene amplification system compensates for loss of copies, thus maintaining copy number, albeit with some fluctuations. The unusual nature of rRNA gene repeats affects cellular functions such as senescence. In addition, we recently found that the repeat number determines sensitivity to DNA damage. In this review, I would like to introduce a new aspect of the rRNA gene repeat (called rDNA) as a center of maintenance of genome integrity and discuss its contribution to evolution.},

Currently, four modules can be searched for: G-bulge loop, kink-turn, C-loop and tandem-GA loop. In control test sequences we found all of the known modules with a false discovery rate of 0.23. Scanning through 1,444 publicly available alignments, we identified 21 yet unreported modules and 141 known modules.

abstract = {We present a comprehensive structural, evolutionary and molecular dynamics (MD) study of the G/U wobble basepairs in the ribosome based on high-resolution crystal structures, including the recent Escherichia coli structure. These basepairs are classified according to their tertiary interactions, and sequence conservation at their positions is determined. G/U basepairs participating in tertiary interactions are more conserved than those lacking any interactions. Specific interactions occurring in the G/U shallow groove pocket--like packing interactions (P-interactions) and some phosphate backbone interactions (phosphate-in-pocket interactions)--lead to higher G/U conservation than others. Two salient cases of unique phylogenetic compensation are discovered. First, a P-interaction is conserved through a series of compensatory mutations involving all four participating nucleotides to preserve or restore the G/U in the optimal orientation. Second, a G/U basepair forming a P-interaction and another one forming a phosphate-in-pocket interaction are replaced by GNRA loops that maintain similar tertiary contacts. MD simulations were carried out on eight P-interactions. The specific GU/CG signature of this interaction observed in structure and sequence analysis was rationalized, and can now be used for improving sequence alignments.},

abstract = {Riboswitches are cis-acting regulatory elements broadly distributed in bacterial mRNAs that control a wide range of critical metabolic activities. Expression is governed by two distinct domains within the mRNA leader: a sensory 'aptamer domain' and a regulatory 'expression platform'. Riboswitches have also received considerable attention as important tools in synthetic biology because of their conceptually simple structure and the ability to obtain aptamers that bind almost any conceivable small molecule using in vitro selection (referred to as SELEX). In the design of artificial riboswitches, a significant hurdle has been to couple the two domains enabling their efficient communication. We previously demonstrated that biological transcriptional 'OFF' expression platforms are easily coupled to diverse aptamers, both biological and SELEX-derived, using simple design rules. Here, we present two modular transcriptional 'ON' riboswitch expression platforms that are also capable of hosting foreign aptamers. We demonstrate that these biological parts can be used to facilely generate artificial chimeric riboswitches capable of robustly regulating transcription both in vitro and in vivo. We expect that these modular expression platforms will be of great utility for various synthetic biological applications that use RNA-based biosensors.},

abstract = {Bacteria that differentiate into highly heat-resistant endospores (HHRS strains) may survive ultrahigh-temperature treatment of milk and germinate in the final product. They do not noticeably spoil the milk and are nonpathogenic. The complete (>96\%) 16S rRNA genes from three HHRS strains were identical, and phylogenetic analysis placed them alongside Bacillus firmus in the B. megaterium group of the genus Bacillus. Moreover, the approximately 550 nucleotides between regions U2 and U5 were invariant for seven HHRS strains. However, three cloned 16S rRNA genes from one HHRS strain, M215, showed marked size and sequence variations within the V1 and V2 regions. DNA reassociation assays confirmed the distinction between a reference HHRS strain and closely related members of the B. megaterium group, notably, B. firmus (30\%), B. benzoevorans (28\%), and B. circulans (20\%). Ribotyping and pyrolysis mass spectrometry both indicated that the HHRS strains belong to a homogeneous, species-ranked taxon, an exception being strain TP1248, which is slightly atypical. The HHRS strains are unusual in that they grow poorly, if at all, on nutrient agar; good growth is obtained on brain heart infusion agar. On subculture, most HHRS strains form long, filamentous rods which stain unevenly in the Gram reaction. They are strictly aerobic and do not produce acid from sugars. We propose the name Bacillus sporothermodurans for these bacteria, which are phenotypically and phylogenetically distinct from other Bacillus species. The type strain is M215 (= DSMZ 10599).},

However, B-form DNA can support only 1 bit of sequence conservation via contacts into the minor groove. The high conservation in RepA sites therefore implies a distorted DNA helix with direct or indirect contacts to the protein. Here I show that a high minor groove conservation signature also appears in sequence logos of sites for other replication origin binding proteins (Rts1, DnaA, P4 alpha, EBNA1, ORC) and promoter binding proteins (sigma(70), sigma(D) factors). This finding implies that DNA binding proteins generally use non-B-form DNA distortion such as base flipping to initiate replication and transcription.},

We observe that ribosomal proteins S13, S19, L16, L25, L27 and L31 are actively involved in the proofreading of tRNA. We suggest that proofreading begins with the monitoring of the entire anticodon loop of tRNA by nucleotides from 16S rRNA (helices 18 and 44) of the small subunit and 23S rRNA (helix 69) of the large subunit with involvement of magnesium ions. Subsequently, the elbow region is scanned by rRNA (helices 38 and 89) and proteins from the large subunit determining whether to accommodate the acceptor end of tRNA in the peptidyl transferase center or not.},

Riboswitch RNAs control a broad range of genes in bacterial species, including those involved in metabolism or uptake of amino acids, cofactors, nucleotides, and metal ions. Regulation occurs as a consequence of direct binding of an effector molecule, or through sensing of a physical parameter such as temperature.

abstract = {Few simple labeling methods exist for simultaneous fluorescence and electron microscopy of bacteria and biofilms. Here we describe the synthesis, characterization, and application of fluorescent nanoparticle quantum dot (QD) conjugates to target microbial species, including difficult to label Gram-negative strains. These QD conjugates impart contrast for both environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and fluorescence microscopy, permitting observation of living and fixed bacteria and biofilms. We apply these probes for studying biofilms extracted from perennial cold springs in the Canadian High Arctic, which is a particularly challenging system. In these biofilms, sulfur-metabolizing bacteria live in close association with unusual sulfur mineral formations. Following simple labeling protocols with the QD conjugates, we are able to image these organisms in fully-hydrated samples and visualize their relationship to the sulfur minerals using both ESEM and fluorescence microscopy. We then use scanning transmission electron microscopy to observe precipitated sulfur around individual cells and within the biofilm lattice. All combined, this information sheds light on the possible mechanisms of biofilm and mineral structure formation. These new QD conjugates and techniques are highly transferable to many other microbiological applications, especially those involving Gram-negative bacteria, and can be used for correlated fluorescence and electron microscopy.},

abstract = {At low temperatures, some organisms produce proteins that affect ice nucleation, ice crystal structure, and/or the process of recrystallization. Based on their ice-interacting properties, these proteins provide an advantage to species that commonly experience the phase change from water to ice or rarely experience temperatures above the melting point. Substances that bind, inhibit or enhance, and control the size, shape, and growth of ice crystals could offer new possibilities for a number of agricultural, biomedical, and industrial applications. Since their discovery more than 40 years ago, ice nucleating and structuring proteins have been used in cryopreservation, frozen food preparation, transgenic crops, and even weather modification. Ice-interacting proteins have demonstrated commercial value in industrial applications; however, the full biotechnological potential of these products has yet to be fully realized. The Earth's cold biosphere contains an almost endless diversity of microorganisms to bioprospect for microbial compounds with novel ice-interacting properties. Microorganisms are the most appropriate biochemical factories to cost effectively produce ice nucleating and structuring proteins on large commercial scales.},

abstract = {Organisms maintain the correct balance of intracellular metals primarily through metal-sensing proteins that control transport and storage of the target ion(s). Here, we reveal the basis of metal sensing and genetic control by a metalloregulatory RNA. Our data demonstrate that a previously uncharacterized orphan riboswitch, renamed the "M-box," is a divalent metal-sensing RNA involved in Mg(2+) homeostasis. A combination of genetic, biochemical, and biophysical techniques demonstrate that Mg(2+) induces a compacted tertiary architecture for M-box RNAs that regulates the accessibility of nucleotides involved in genetic control. Molecular details are provided by crystallographic structure determination of a Mg(2+)-bound M-box RNA. Given the distribution of this RNA element, it may constitute a common mode for bacterial metal ion regulation, and its discovery suggests the possibility of additional RNA-based metal sensors in modern and primordial organisms.},

abstract = {RNA molecules fold into characteristic secondary and tertiary structures that account for their diverse functional activities. Many of these RNA structures are assembled from a collection of RNA structural motifs. These basic building blocks are used repeatedly, and in various combinations, to form different RNA types and define their unique structural and functional properties. Identification of recurring RNA structural motifs will therefore enhance our understanding of RNA structure and help associate elements of RNA structure with functional and regulatory elements. Our goal was to develop a computer program that can describe an RNA structural element of any complexity and then search any nucleotide sequence database, including the complete prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, for these structural elements. Here we describe in detail a new computational motif search algorithm, RNAMotif, and demonstrate its utility with some motif search examples. RNAMotif differs from other motif search tools in two important aspects: first, the structure definition language is more flexible and can specify any type of base-base interaction; second, RNAMotif provides a user controlled scoring section that can be used to add capabilities that patterns alone cannot provide.},

We define this sub-branch as the 'Shewanella barophile branch' containing at least two different species.

abstract = {The increased protein proportion of archaeal and eukaryal ribonuclease (RNase) P holoenzymes parallels a vast decrease in the catalytic activity of their RNA subunits (P RNAs) alone. We show that a few mutations toward the bacterial P RNA consensus substantially activate the catalytic (C-) domain of archaeal P RNA from Methanothermobacter, in the absence and presence of the bacterial RNase P protein. Large increases in ribozyme activity required the cooperative effect of at least two structural alterations. The P1 helix of P RNA from Methanothermobacter was found to be extended, which increases ribozyme activity (ca 200-fold) and stabilizes the tertiary structure. Activity increases of mutated archaeal C-domain variants were more pronounced in the context of chimeric P RNAs carrying the bacterial specificity (S-) domain of Escherichia coli instead of the archaeal S-domain. This could be explained by the loss of the archaeal S-domain's capacity to support tight and productive substrate binding in the absence of protein cofactors. Our results demonstrate that the catalytic capacity of archaeal P RNAs is close to that of their bacterial counterparts, but is masked by minor changes in the C-domain and, particularly, by poor function of the archaeal S-domain in the absence of archaeal protein cofactors.},

Because most water on present-day Mars is frozen in the regolith, permafrosts are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian subsurface environment. Six bacterial isolates were obtained from a permafrost borehole in northeastern Siberia capable of growth under conditions of low temperature (0 °C), low pressure (7 mbar), and a CO(2)-enriched anoxic atmosphere. By 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, all six permafrost isolates were identified as species of the genus Carnobacterium, most closely related to C. inhibens (five isolates) and C. viridans (one isolate). Quantitative growth assays demonstrated that the six permafrost isolates, as well as nine type species of Carnobacterium (C. alterfunditum, C. divergens, C. funditum, C. gallinarum, C. inhibens, C. maltaromaticum, C. mobile, C. pleistocenium, and C. viridans) were all capable of growth under cold, low-pressure, anoxic conditions, thus extending the low-pressure extreme at which life can function.},

For the 64 domains with readily identified templates, the best submitted model was better than the best alignment to the best template in the Protein Data Bank for 24 cases, and improved over the best starting model for 43 cases. For 13 targets where only very distant sequence relationships to proteins of known structure were detected, models were generated using the Rosetta de novo structure prediction methodology followed by all-atom refinement; in several cases the submitted models were better than those based on the available templates. Of the 12 refinement challenges, the best submitted model improved on the starting model in seven cases. These improvements over the starting template-based models and refinement tests demonstrate the power of Rosetta structure refinement in improving model accuracy.},

abstract = {We attempted to overexpress chalcone synthase (CHS) in pigmented petunia petals by introducing a chimeric petunia CHS gene. Unexpectedly, the introduced gene created a block in anthocyanin biosynthesis. Forty-two percent of plants with the introduced CHS gene produced totally white flowers and/or patterned flowers with white or pale nonclonal sectors on a wild-type pigmented background; none of hundreds of transgenic control plants exhibited such phenotypes. Progeny testing of one plant demonstrated that the novel color phenotype co-segregated with the introduced CHS gene; progeny without this gene were phenotypically wild type. The somatic and germinal stability of the novel color patterns was variable. RNase protection analysis of petal RNAs isolated from white flowers showed that, although the developmental timing of mRNA expression of the endogenous CHS gene was not altered, the level of the mRNA produced by this gene was reduced 50-fold from wild-type levels. Somatic reversion of plants with white flowers to phenotypically parental violet flowers was associated with a coordinate rise in the steady-state levels of the mRNAs produced by both the endogenous and the introduced CHS genes. Thus, in the altered white flowers, the expression of both genes was coordinately suppressed, indicating that expression of the introduced CHS gene was not alone sufficient for suppression of endogenous CHS transcript levels. The mechanism responsible for the reversible co-suppression of homologous genes in trans is unclear, but the erratic and reversible nature of this phenomenon suggests the possible involvement of methylation.},

Here, we describe a computational analysis of sequence features involved in recognition of short introns by using available transcript data from five eukaryotes with complete or nearly complete genomic sequences. The information content of five different transcript features was measured by using methods from information theory, and Monte Carlo simulations were used to determine the amount of information required for accurate recognition of short introns in each organism. We conclude: (i) that short introns in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans contain essentially all of the information for their recognition by the splicing machinery, and computer programs that simulate splicing specificity can predict the exact boundaries of approximately 95\% of short introns in both organisms; (ii) that in yeast, the 5'ss, branch signal, and 3'ss can accurately identify intron locations but do not precisely determine the location of 3' cleavage in every intron; and (iii) that the 5'ss, branch signal, and 3'ss are not sufficient to accurately identify short introns in plant and human transcripts, but that specific subsets of candidate intronic enhancer motifs can be identified in both human and Arabidopsis that contribute dramatically to the accuracy of splicing simulators.},

abstract = {Community network analysis derived from molecular dynamics simulations is used to identify and compare the signaling pathways in a bacterial glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS):tRNA(Glu) and an archaeal leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS):tRNA(Leu) complex. Although the 2 class I synthetases have remarkably different interactions with their cognate tRNAs, the allosteric networks for charging tRNA with the correct amino acid display considerable similarities. A dynamic contact map defines the edges connecting nodes (amino acids and nucleotides) in the physical network whose overall topology is presented as a network of communities, local substructures that are highly intraconnected, but loosely interconnected. Whereas nodes within a single community can communicate through many alternate pathways, the communication between monomers in different communities has to take place through a smaller number of critical edges or interactions. Consistent with this analysis, there are a large number of suboptimal paths that can be used for communication between the identity elements on the tRNAs and the catalytic site in the aaRS:tRNA complexes. Residues and nucleotides in the majority of pathways for intercommunity signal transmission are evolutionarily conserved and are predicted to be important for allosteric signaling. The same monomers are also found in a majority of the suboptimal paths. Modifying these residues or nucleotides has a large effect on the communication pathways in the protein:RNA complex consistent with kinetic data.},

Search for protein sites (SPRITE) and amino acid pattern search for substructures and motifs (ASSAM) are graph theoretical programs that can search for 3D amino side chain matches in protein structures, by representing the amino acid side chains as pseudo-atoms. The geometric relationship of the pseudo-atoms to each other as a pattern can be represented as a labeled graph where the pseudo-atoms are the graph's nodes while the edges are the inter-pseudo-atomic distances. Both programs require the input file to be in the PDB format. The objective of using SPRITE is to identify matches of side chains in a query structure to patterns with characterized function. In contrast, a 3D pattern of interest can be searched for existing occurrences in available PDB structures using ASSAM. Both programs are freely accessible without any login requirement. SPRITE is available at http://mfrlab.org/grafss/sprite/ while ASSAM can be accessed at http://mfrlab.org/grafss/assam/.},

abstract = {Six slightly halophilic, thermophilic bacterial strains were isolated from saline hot springs along the Bay of Naples, Italy. These strains produce bright yellow colonies and have a filamentous morphology and an optimum growth temperature of about 60 degrees C. Lipid composition and 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analyses showed that these strains belong to the genus Thermonema, a member of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides phylum. Growth was observed in medium containing 1 to 3\% NaCl. The DNA G + C content was 50.9 mol\%. DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed that these strains represent a new species of the genus Thermonema. We propose that strain NR-27T (T = type strain) and the other strains represent a new species, Thermonema rossianum. Strain NR-27 (= DSM 10300) is the type strain of this species.},

abstract = {The signal recognition particle (SRP) targets proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes or to the inner membrane in prokaryotes by binding to hydrophobic signal sequences. Signal peptide recognition occurs within the highly conserved RNA-protein core of the SRP, underscoring the importance of this complex in SRP function. Structural analysis of the RNA and protein components of the prokaryotic SRP in the free and bound states revealed that the RNA undergoes a significant conformational change upon protein binding involving the uptake of several monovalent and divalent cations. To investigate the role of these metal ions in formation of the functional SRP complex, we used binding affinity assays and X-ray crystallography to analyze the specificity and energetic contributions of mono- and divalent metal ions bound in the RNA. Our results demonstrate that several metal ion binding sites important for RNA conformation can accommodate chemically distinct ions, often without affecting the structure of the complex. Thus, while these metal ions are highly ordered and essential for the formation and stability of the SRP complex, they behave like nonspecific metal ions.},

abstract = {The pressure-temperature phase diagram of various biomolecules is reviewed. Special attention is focused on the elliptic phase diagram of proteins. The phenomenological thermodynamic theory describing this diagram explains the heat, cold and pressure denaturations in a unified picture. The limitations and possible developments of this theory are discussed as well. It is pointed out that a more complex diagram can be obtained when the intermolecular interactions are also taken into account. In this case metastable states appear on the pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram due to intermolecular interactions. Pressure-temperature phase diagrams of other biopolymers are also discussed. While the p-T diagrams of helix-coil transition of nucleic acids and of gel-liquid crystal transition of lipid bilayers are non-elliptical, those of gelatinization of starch and of phase separation of some synthetic polymers show an elliptic profile, similar to that of proteins. Finally, the p-T diagram of bacterial inactivation is shown to be elliptic. From the point of view of basic science, this fact shows that the key factor of inactivation should be the protein type, and from the viewpoint of practical applications, it serves as the theoretical basis of pressure treatment of biosystems.},

abstract = {In comparison to other biomolecules, the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the conformational stability of DNA and RNA has received scant attention. However, the increasing interest in the hydration of biological molecules has resulted in a concomitant increase in the number of investigations of the effect of pressure upon the structure of nucleic acids. In this review, studies concerning the effect of pressure on DNA and RNA oligomers and polymers are presented. The greatest amount of research has been directed at studying the effect of pressure on the stability of the double helix. In general, under most conditions, the helical form of DNA or RNA is stabilized by pressure. The extent of stabilization is small relative to the effect of pressure on other biomolecular systems such as lipid membranes or protein quaternary structure. The absence of a larger pressure effect arises, in part because the state of ionization does not change as a function of the helical state. Initial experiments have also appeared on the effect of pressure upon helix-formation kinetics, B-Z and A-Z equilibria, and DNA topology. Fourier-transform ir spectroscopy of DNA polymers under high pressure has yielded data that showing that pressure does not induce large-scale structural changes.},

Light scattering experiments at pressures up to 1000 bar reveal different susceptibility of tight couple and loose couple ribosomes toward pressure dissociation. Tight couples are subjected to EF-Tu-catalyzed binding of aminoacyl-tRNA, thus yielding a model system of the elongating ribosome before the peptidyl transfer step. High pressure dissociation of this compound suggests that enzymatic binding converts tight couples into loose couples. A hypothesis referring to conformational changes during the elongation cycle is presented.},

The existence of these domains in Escherichia coli was investigated by the ability of different lengths of (CG) tracts, cloned upstream or downstream from the tetracycline resistance gene (tet) of pBR322, to adopt the Z structure in vivo. Segments as short as 12 base pairs adopt the Z form when cloned upstream from the tet gene (Eco RI site), whereas no Z DNA was detected when this sequence was cloned downstream (Sty I site), even with a 74-base pair (CG) tract that requires less supercoiling than shorter tracts for the B-Z transition. Hence the localized supercoil density in pBR322 can be as high as -0.038 and as low as -0.021 at different loci. These data demonstrate the existence of the Z structure for commonly found natural sequences and support the notion of domains of negative supercoiling in vivo.},

abstract = {A probabilistic graphical model is proposed in order to detect the coevolution between different sites in biological sequences. The model extends the continuous-time Markov process of sequence substitution for single nucleic or amino acids and imposes general constraints regarding simultaneous changes on the substitution rate matrix. Given a multiple sequence alignment for each molecule of interest and a phylogenetic tree, the model can predict potential interactions within or between nucleic acids and proteins. Initial validation of the model is carried out using tRNA and 16S rRNA sequence data. The model accurately identifies the secondary interactions of tRNA as well as several known tertiary interactions. In addition, results on 16S rRNA data indicate this general and simple coevolutionary model outperforms several other parametric and nonparametric methods in predicting secondary interactions. Furthermore, the majority of the putative predictions exhibit either direct contact or proximity of the nucleotide pairs in the 3-dimensional structure of the Thermus thermophilus ribosomal small subunit. The results on RNA data suggest a general model of coevolution might be applied to other types of interactions between protein, DNA, and RNA molecules.},

abstract = {Eleven psychrophilic bacteria were isolated from a solid layer of fast ice in the middle of Pointe-Geologie Archipelago, Adelie Land, Antarctica. The 11 isolates based on the phenotypic characteristics, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analysis have been identified as members of the genus Halomonas. All the isolates at the 16S rDNA sequence level were identical, possessed the 15 conserved nucleotides of the family Halomonadaceae and four nucleotides of the genus Halomonas. Therefore, the 16S rDNA sequence of DD 39 was used for calculating the evolutionary distances and for phylogenetic analysis. It was observed that DD 39 formed a robust cluster with H. variabilis, from which it differed by 0.7\%. Further DNA-DNA hybridization studies indicated low DNA-DNA homology (15\%) between H. variabilis and DD 39. Between the 11 Antarctic isolates the homology was >85\%. In addition it was observed that DD 39 was different from H. variabilis in that it was psychrophilic, could tolerate only up to 15\% sodium chloride, could not hydrolyse esculin, could not reduce nitrate, was urease negative, could not utilize glycerol as a carbon source, and was resistant to ampicillin and erythromycin and sensitive to nalidixic acid. In addition, it also exhibited distinct differences with respect to high content of C(16:1) and low levels of cyclo-C(17:0) and cyclo-C(19:0). DD 39 also differed from all the other reported species of Halomonas with respect to many phenotypic characteristics. It is proposed therefore that DD 39 should be placed in the genus Halomonas as a new species that is Halomonas glaciei. The type strain of H. glaciei is DD 39(T) (MTCC 4321; JCM 11692).},

The local rules theory of Berger et al. (1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91, 7732-7736), previously developed to explain aspects of icosahedral capsid assembly, has been applied to the papovavirus geometry. Local rules describe capsid symmetry patterns in terms of the local interactions of assembly units, such as coat proteins or capsomeres. Polymorphic assemblies, including T = 1 icosahedral, dodecahedral, spiral, and tubular structures of the polyomavirus VP1 protein, can be induced by specific mutations or changes in the solvent conditions during in vitro assembly of the recombinant coat protein. Local rules models were developed to model the wild-type capsid and several polymorphic assemblies. Some assemblies corresponded to structures modeled by small deviations from wild-type local rules. We conclude that aspects of polyomavirus assembly are consistent with local rules models, although they do not explain all polymorphisms. These results may provide insights into the nature of papovavirus assembly, constraints on assembly pathways, and strategies for disrupting assembly.},

The multiprotein mitochondrial RNA-binding complex 1 (MRB1) is emerging as an equally essential component of the trypanosome RNA editing machinery, with additional functions in gRNA and mRNA stabilization. The distinct and overlapping protein compositions of reported MRB1 complexes and diverse MRB1 functions suggest that the complex is composed of subcomplexes with RNA-dependent and independent interactions. To determine the architecture of the MRB1 complex, we performed a comprehensive yeast two-hybrid analysis of 31 reported MRB1 proteins. We also used in vivo analyses of tagged MRB1 components to confirm direct and RNA-mediated interactions. Here, we show that MRB1 contains a core complex comprised of six proteins and maintained by numerous direct interactions. The MRB1 core associates with multiple subcomplexes and proteins through RNA-enhanced or RNA-dependent interactions. These findings provide a framework for interpretation of previous functional studies and suggest that MRB1 is a dynamic complex that coordinates various aspects of mitochondrial gene regulation.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the protein structures in the 30 S ribosomal subunit from Thermus thermophilus, and their interactions with 16 S RNA based on a crystal structure at 3.05 A resolution. With 20 different polypeptide chains, the 30 S subunit adds significantly to our data base of RNA structure and protein-RNA interactions. In addition to globular domains, many of the proteins have long, extended regions, either in the termini or in internal loops, which make extensive contact to the RNA component and are involved in stabilizing RNA tertiary structure. Many ribosomal proteins share similar alpha+beta sandwich folds, but we show that the topology of this domain varies considerably, as do the ways in which the proteins interact with RNA. Analysis of the protein-RNA interactions in the context of ribosomal assembly shows that the primary binders are globular proteins that bind at RNA multihelix junctions, whereas proteins with long extensions assemble later. We attempt to correlate the structure with a large body of biochemical and genetic data on the 30 S subunit.},

abstract = {Metal ions are essential for the folding of RNA into stable tertiary structures and for the catalytic activity of some RNA enzymes. To aid in the study of the roles of metal ions in RNA structural biology, we have created MeRNA (Metals in RNA), a comprehensive compilation of all metal binding sites identified in RNA 3D structures available from the PDB and Nucleic Acid Database. Currently, our database contains information relating to binding of 9764 metal ions corresponding to 23 distinct elements, in 256 RNA structures. The metal ion locations were confirmed and ligands characterized using original literature references. MeRNA includes eight manually identified metal-ion binding motifs, which are described in the literature. MeRNA is searchable by PDB identifier, metal ion, method of structure determination, resolution and R-values for X-ray structure and distance from metal to any RNA atom or to water. New structures with their respective binding motifs will be added to the database as they become available. The MeRNA database will further our understanding of the roles of metal ions in RNA folding and catalysis and have applications in structural and functional analysis, RNA design and engineering. The MeRNA database is accessible at http://merna.lbl.gov.},

abstract = {Two strictly aerobic, Gram-negative, gliding, apricot- to pale-orange-pigmented, rod-shaped bacteria, strains YM11-185T and YM11-159, were isolated from marine sediments in the Republic of Palau. Preliminary analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the novel isolates could be affiliated with the family 'Flammeovirgaceae' of the phylum Bacteroidetes. Strains YM11-185T and YM11-159 shared 100 \% sequence similarity and showed less than 90 \% similarity to cultivated representatives of the family 'Flammeovirgaceae'. The novel isolates are phenotypically and physiologically different from strains described previously. The G+C content of DNA was 27.8-27.9 mol\%, MK-7 was the major menaquinone and iso-C15 : 0 and C16 : 1 omega 7c were the major fatty acids. On the basis of polyphasic taxonomic studies, it was concluded that strains YM11-185T and YM11-159 represent a novel species in a new genus of the family 'Flammeovirgaceae', for which the name Limibacter armeniacum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Limibacter armeniacum is YM11-185T (=MBIC08286T =KCTC 22132T).},

@article{Gredell2008,
abstract = {The selection of active siRNAs is generally based on identifying siRNAs with certain sequence and structural properties. However, the efficiency of RNA interference has also been shown to depend on the structure of the target mRNA, primarily through studies using exogenous transcripts with well-defined secondary structures in the vicinity of the target sequence. While these studies provide a means for examining the impact of target sequence and structure independently, the predicted secondary structures for these transcripts are often not reflective of structures that form in full-length, native mRNAs where interactions can occur between relatively remote segments of the mRNAs. Here, using a combination of experimental results and analysis of a large dataset, we demonstrate that the accessibility of certain local target structures on the mRNA is an important determinant in the gene silencing ability of siRNAs. siRNAs targeting the enhanced green fluorescent protein were chosen using a minimal siRNA selection algorithm followed by classification based on the predicted minimum free energy structures of the target transcripts. Transfection into HeLa and HepG2 cells revealed that siRNAs targeting regions of the mRNA predicted to have unpaired 5'- and 3'-ends resulted in greater gene silencing than regions predicted to have other types of secondary structure. These results were confirmed by analysis of gene silencing data from previously published siRNAs, which showed that mRNA target regions unpaired at either the 5'-end or 3'-end were silenced, on average, approximately 10\% more strongly than target regions unpaired in the center or primarily paired throughout. We found this effect to be independent of the structure of the siRNA guide strand. Taken together, these results suggest minimal requirements for nucleation of hybridization between the siRNA guide strand and mRNA and that both mRNA and guide strand structure should be considered when choosing candidate siRNAs.},

The cells have an extremely high potassium content, the ratio K(+)/protein being in the same range as in halophilic Archaea of the order Halobacteriales. X-ray microanalysis in the electron microscope of cells grown in medium of 250 g l(-1) salt confirmed the high intracellular K(+)concentrations, and showed intracellular chloride to be about as high as the cation concentrations within the cells. A search for intracellular organic osmotic solutes, using (13)C-NMR and HPLC techniques, showed glutamate, glycine betaine, and N-alpha-acetyllysine to be present in low concentrations only, contributing very little to the overall osmotic balance. The results presented suggest that the extremely halophilic Bacterium Salinibacteruses a similar mode of haloadaptation to that of the Archaea of the order Halobacteriales, and does not accumulate organic osmotic solutes such as are used by all other known halophilic and halotolerant aerobic Bacteria.},

abstract = {Crowder molecules in solution alter the equilibrium between folded and unfolded states of biological macromolecules. It is therefore critical to account for the influence of these other molecules when describing the folding of RNA inside the cell. Small angle X-ray scattering experiments are reported on a 64 kDa bacterial group I ribozyme in the presence of polyethylene-glycol 1000 (PEG-1000), a molecular crowder with an average molecular weight of 1000 Da. In agreement with expected excluded volume effects, PEG favors more compact RNA structures. First, the transition from the unfolded to the folded (more compact) state occurs at lower MgCl(2) concentrations in PEG. Second, the radius of gyration of the unfolded RNA decreases from 76 to 64 A as the PEG concentration increases from 0 to 20\% wt/vol. Changes to water and ion activities were measured experimentally, and theoretical models were used to evaluate the excluded volume. We conclude that the dominant influence of the PEG crowder on the folding process is the excluded volume effect.},

@article{Kettler2007,
abstract = {Prochlorococcus is a marine cyanobacterium that numerically dominates the mid-latitude oceans and is the smallest known oxygenic phototroph. Numerous isolates from diverse areas of the world's oceans have been studied and shown to be physiologically and genetically distinct. All isolates described thus far can be assigned to either a tightly clustered high-light (HL)-adapted clade, or a more divergent low-light (LL)-adapted group. The 16S rRNA sequences of the entire Prochlorococcus group differ by at most 3\%, and the four initially published genomes revealed patterns of genetic differentiation that help explain physiological differences among the isolates. Here we describe the genomes of eight newly sequenced isolates and combine them with the first four genomes for a comprehensive analysis of the core (shared by all isolates) and flexible genes of the Prochlorococcus group, and the patterns of loss and gain of the flexible genes over the course of evolution. There are 1,273 genes that represent the core shared by all 12 genomes. They are apparently sufficient, according to metabolic reconstruction, to encode a functional cell. We describe a phylogeny for all 12 isolates by subjecting their complete proteomes to three different phylogenetic analyses. For each non-core gene, we used a maximum parsimony method to estimate which ancestor likely first acquired or lost each gene. Many of the genetic differences among isolates, especially for genes involved in outer membrane synthesis and nutrient transport, are found within the same clade. Nevertheless, we identified some genes defining HL and LL ecotypes, and clades within these broad ecotypes, helping to demonstrate the basis of HL and LL adaptations in Prochlorococcus. Furthermore, our estimates of gene gain events allow us to identify highly variable genomic islands that are not apparent through simple pairwise comparisons. These results emphasize the functional roles, especially those connected to outer membrane synthesis and transport that dominate the flexible genome and set it apart from the core. Besides identifying islands and demonstrating their role throughout the history of Prochlorococcus, reconstruction of past gene gains and losses shows that much of the variability exists at the "leaves of the tree," between the most closely related strains. Finally, the identification of core and flexible genes from this 12-genome comparison is largely consistent with the relative frequency of Prochlorococcus genes found in global ocean metagenomic databases, further closing the gap between our understanding of these organisms in the lab and the wild.},

abstract = {The recognition of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and its precursor, the RISC loading complex (RLC), is a key step in the RNA interference pathway that controls the subsequent sequence-specific mRNA degradation. In Drosophila, selection of the guide strand has been shown to be mediated by RLC protein R2D2, which senses the relative hybridization stability between the two ends of the siRNA. A protein with similar function has yet to be conclusively identified in humans. We show here that human TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) alone can bind siRNAs in vitro and sense their asymmetry. We also show that TRBP can bind 21-nucleotide single-stranded RNAs, though with far lower affinity than for double-stranded siRNA, and that TRBP cross-links preferentially to the 3'-ends of the guide strands of siRNAs. This suggests that TRBP binding depends both on the sequences of the siRNA strands and on the relative hybridization stability of the ends of the duplex. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the siRNA-TRBP interaction in the selection of the siRNA guide strand in RNAi.},

The diverse roles of RNA depend on its ability to fold back on itself to form biologically functional structures that bind small molecule and large protein ligands, to change conformation, and to affect the cellular regulatory state. These features of RNA biology can be structurally interrogated using chemical mapping experiments. The usefulness and applications of RNA chemical probing technologies have expanded dramatically over the past five years because of several critical advances. These innovations include new sequence-independent RNA chemistries, algorithmic tools for high-throughput analysis of complex data sets composed of thousands of measurements, new approaches for interpreting chemical probing data for both secondary and tertiary structure prediction, facile methods for following time-dependent processes, and the willingness of individual research groups to tackle increasingly bold problems in RNA structural biology.},

@article{Humphry2001,
abstract = {A psychrophilic, aerobic bacterium designated A2iT was isolated from marine sediment recovered from shallow waters surrounding Adelaide Island, Antarctica (67 degrees 34' S, 68 degrees 07' W). The organism exhibited xylanolytic and laminarinolytic activity and was halotolerant. Basic characterization showed that it was gram-negative, non-motile, yellow-pigmented (beta,beta-carotene-3,3'-diol) and positive for oxidase and catalase synthesis. Analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence suggests that the organism belongs to the Flexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroides phylum. On the basis of its 16S rDNA sequence, the bacterium is 96.8\% similar to Flavobacterium columnare ATCC 43622--its closest relation. The genomic DNA G+C content was 35 mol\%. Growth on xylan occurs optimally at 15 degrees C, though growth also occurs at 0 degrees C, and the doubling times are 9.6 and 34.8 h, respectively. The maximum growth temperature on xylan is at 24 degrees C. The bacterium is a neutrophile, growing across the pH range 5.6-8.4 and having an optimum at pH 7.5. Analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence, together with phenotypic characterization, suggests that the organism is a member of the genus Flavobacterium. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments have shown that it is a novel species; it is proposed, therefore, that the organism be designated as the type strain of Flavobacterium frigidarium sp. nov.

abstract = {Structures of anisomycin, chloramphenicol, sparsomycin, blasticidin S, and virginiamycin M bound to the large ribosomal subunit of Haloarcula marismortui have been determined at 3.0A resolution. Most of these antibiotics bind to sites that overlap those of either peptidyl-tRNA or aminoacyl-tRNA, consistent with their functioning as competitive inhibitors of peptide bond formation. Two hydrophobic crevices, one at the peptidyl transferase center and the other at the entrance to the peptide exit tunnel play roles in binding these antibiotics. Midway between these crevices, nucleotide A2103 of H.marismortui (2062 Escherichia coli) varies in its conformation and thereby contacts antibiotics bound at either crevice. The aromatic ring of anisomycin binds to the active-site hydrophobic crevice, as does the aromatic ring of puromycin, while the aromatic ring of chloramphenicol binds to the exit tunnel hydrophobic crevice. Sparsomycin contacts primarily a P-site bound substrate, but also extends into the active-site hydrophobic crevice. Virginiamycin M occupies portions of both the A and P-site, and induces a conformational change in the ribosome. Blasticidin S base-pairs with the P-loop and thereby mimics C74 and C75 of a P-site bound tRNA.},

We investigated the mechanism of chaperone-mediated RNA folding by following the time-resolved dimerization of the packaging domain of a retroviral RNA at nucleotide resolution. In the absence of the nucleocapsid (NC) chaperone, dimerization proceeded via multiple, slow-folding intermediates. In the presence of NC, dimerization occurred rapidly via a single structural intermediate. The RNA binding domain of hnRNP A1 protein (UP1), a structurally unrelated chaperone, also accelerated dimerization. Both chaperones interacted primarily with guanosine residues. Replacing guanosine with more weakly pairing inosine yielded an RNA that folded rapidly without a facilitating chaperone. These results show that RNA chaperones can simplify RNA folding landscapes by weakening intramolecular interactions involving guanosine and explain many RNA chaperone activities.},

Here, we report precise control of perturbation and reconfiguration of gene circuits in living cells by optically addressable siRNA-Au nanoantennas. The siRNA-Au nanoantennas fulfill dual functions as selectively addressable optical receivers and biomolecular emitters of small interfering RNA (siRNA). Using siRNA-Au nanoantennas as optical inputs to existing circuit connections, photonic gene circuits are constructed in living cells. We show that photonic gene circuits are modular, enabling subcircuits to be combined on-demand. Photonic gene circuits open new avenues for engineering functional gene circuits useful for fundamental bioscience, bioengineering, and medical applications.},

Exciting new findings have revealed a critical role for regulatory elements within the mRNA untranslated regions to direct the timing of mRNA translation. Regulatory elements can be targeted by sequence-specific binding proteins to direct either repression or activation of mRNA translation in response to developmental signals. As new regulatory elements continue to be identified it has become clear that targeted mRNAs can contain multiple regulatory elements, directing apparently contradictory translational patterns. How is this complex regulatory input integrated? In this review, we focus on a new challenge area-how sequence-specific RNA binding proteins respond to developmental signals and functionally integrate to regulate the extent and timing of target mRNA translation. We discuss current understanding with a particular emphasis on the control of cell cycle progression that is mediated through a complex interplay of distinct mRNA regulatory elements during Xenopus oocyte maturation.

abstract = {Explicit solvent and counterion molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out for a total of >80 ns on the bacterial and spinach chloroplast 5S rRNA Loop E motifs. The Loop E sequences form unique duplex architectures composed of seven consecutive non-Watson-Crick basepairs. The starting structure of spinach chloroplast Loop E was modeled using isostericity principles, and the simulations refined the geometries of the three non-Watson-Crick basepairs that differ from the consensus bacterial sequence. The deep groove of Loop E motifs provides unique sites for cation binding. Binding of Mg(2+) rigidifies Loop E and stabilizes its major groove at an intermediate width. In the absence of Mg(2+), the Loop E motifs show an unprecedented degree of inner-shell binding of monovalent cations that, in contrast to Mg(2+), penetrate into the most negative regions inside the deep groove. The spinach chloroplast Loop E shows a marked tendency to compress its deep groove compared with the bacterial consensus. Structures with a narrow deep groove essentially collapse around a string of Na(+) cations with long coordination times. The Loop E non-Watson-Crick basepairing is complemented by highly specific hydration sites ranging from water bridges to hydration pockets hosting 2 to 3 long-residing waters. The ordered hydration is intimately connected with RNA local conformational variations.},

abstract = {The amyloid-like fibril is considered to be a macromolecular self-assemblage with a highly-ordered quaternary structure, in which numerous beta-stranded polypeptide chains align regularly. Therefore, this kind of fibril has the potential to be engineered into proteinaceous materials, although conformational alteration of proteins from their native form to the amyloid form is a misfolding and undesirable process related to amyloid diseases. In this study, we have attempted to design an artificial system to explore applicability of using the amyloid-like fibril as a construct possessing self-recognition and self-catalytic abilities. A peptide self-replicating system based on the beta-structure of the amyloid-like fibril was designed and constructed. The beta-stranded peptide was self-replicated by the native chemical ligation reaction, and the newly generated peptide was self-assembled into amyloid-like fibrils. Thus, the constructed system was of both chemical and conformational self-replicating fibrils.},

abstract = {Among the different cellular surveillance mechanisms in charge to prevent production of faulty gene products, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) represents a translation-dependent posttranscriptional process that selectively recognizes and degrades mRNAs whose open reading frame (ORF) is truncated by a premature translation termination codon (PTC, also called "nonsense codon"). In doing so, NMD protects the cell from accumulating C-terminally truncated proteins with potentially deleterious functions. Transcriptome profiling of NMD-deficient yeast, Drosophila, and human cells revealed that 3-10\% of all mRNA levels are regulated (directly or indirectly) by NMD, indicating an important role of NMD in gene regulation that extends beyond quality control [J. Rehwinkel, J. Raes, E. Izaurralde, Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay: Target genes and functional diversification of effectors, Trends Biochem. Sci. 31 (2006) 639-646.[1]]. In this review, we focus on recent results from different model organisms that indicate an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for PTC identification.},

abstract = {A hyperthermophilic, sulfur-reducing, organo-heterotrophic archaeon, strain OGL-20P(T), was isolated from 'black smoker' chimney material from the Rainbow hydrothermal vent site on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (36.2 degrees N, 33.9 degrees W). The cells of strain OGL-20P(T) have an irregular coccoid shape and are motile with a single flagellum. Growth was observed within a pH range of 5.0-8.5 (optimum pH 7.0), an NaCl concentration range of 1-5 \% (w/v) (optimum 3 \%) and a temperature range of 55-94 degrees C (optimum 83-85 degrees C). The novel isolate is strictly anaerobic and obligately dependent upon elemental sulfur as an electron acceptor, but it does not reduce sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, Fe(III) or nitrate. Proteolysis products (peptone, bacto-tryptone, Casamino acids and yeast extract) are utilized as substrates during sulfur reduction. Strain OGL-20P(T) is resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin and gentamicin, but sensitive to tetracycline and rifampicin. The G+C content of the DNA is 52.9 mol\%. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain OGL-20P(T) is closely related to Thermococcus coalescens and related species, but no significant homology by DNA-DNA hybridization was observed between those species and the new isolate. On the basis of physiological and molecular properties of the new isolate, we conclude that strain OGL-20P(T) represents a new separate species within the genus Thermococcus, for which we propose the name Thermococcus thioreducens sp. nov. The type strain is OGL-20P(T) (=JCM 12859(T)=DSM 14981(T)=ATCC BAA-394(T)).},

abstract = {High-throughput experiments and bioinformatics techniques are creating an exploding volume of data that are becoming overwhelming to keep track of for biologists and researchers who need to access, analyze and process existing data. Much of the available data are being deposited in specialized databases, such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for microarrays or the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for protein structures and coordinates. Data sets are also being described by their authors in publications archived in literature databases such as MEDLINE and PubMed Central. Currently, the curation of links between biological databases and the literature mainly relies on manual labour, which makes it a time-consuming and daunting task. Herein, we analysed the current state of link curation between GEO, PDB and MEDLINE. We found that the link curation is heterogeneous depending on the sources and databases involved, and that overlap between sources is low, <50\% for PDB and GEO. Furthermore, we showed that text-mining tools can automatically provide valuable evidence to help curators broaden the scope of articles and database entries that they review. As a result, we made recommendations to improve the coverage of curated links, as well as the consistency of information available from different databases while maintaining high-quality curation.

abstract = {Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) was previously reported to be associated with human prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome. Our groups recently showed that XMRV was created through recombination between two endogenous murine retroviruses, PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2, during the passaging of a prostate tumor xenograft in nude mice. Here, multiple approaches that led to the identification of PreXMRV-2, as well as the distribution of both parental proviruses among different mouse species, are described. The chromosomal loci of both proviruses were determined in the mouse genome, and integration site information was used to analyze the distribution of both proviruses in 48 laboratory mouse strains and 46 wild-derived strains. The strain distributions of PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2 are quite different, the former being found predominantly in Asian mice and the latter in European mice, making it unlikely that the two XMRV ancestors could have recombined independently in the wild to generate an infectious virus. XMRV was not present in any of the mouse strains tested, and among the wild-derived mouse strains analyzed, not a single mouse carried both parental proviruses. Interestingly, PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2 were found together in three laboratory strains, Hsd nude, NU/NU, and C57BR/cd, consistent with previous data that the recombination event that led to the generation of XMRV could have occurred only in the laboratory. The three laboratory strains carried the Xpr1(n) receptor variant nonpermissive to XMRV and xenotropic murine leukemia virus (X-MLV) infection, suggesting that the xenografted human tumor cells were required for the resulting XMRV recombinant to infect and propagate.},

abstract = {Microbiological studies of polar ice at different depths may provide important comparisons, as they preserve records of microbial cells and past climate. In this study, we examined bacterial abundance, diversity and glaciochemical composition from three depths of an ice core from coastal Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. Higher bacterial abundance corresponded with high in situ sea-salt Na(+) and dust concentration, suggesting that bacteria might have been transported and deposited into ice along with dust particles and marine aerosols. Fourteen bacterial isolates belonging to the genera Methylobacterium, Brevundimonas, Paenibacillus, Bacillus and Micrococcus were retrieved. Frequent isolation of similar bacterial genera from different cold environments suggests that they possess features that enable survival and metabolism for extended periods of time at sub-zero temperatures. The highest number and diversity of recoverable bacteria was obtained from 49 m depth corresponding to 1926 AD and consisted of bacteria from 4 different genera whereas at 11 m (1989 AD) and 33 m (1953 AD) samples only species belonging to the genera Bacillus was recovered. Among the Bacillus species, Bacillus aryabhattai which has been reported only from the upper stratosphere, was isolated and is the first record from the Earth's surface. Methylobacterium was the most dominant genera at 49 m depth and its prevalence is attributable to a combination of high in situ methanesulfonate concentration, specialized metabolism and environmental hardiness of Methylobacterium. Some of the isolated bacteria were found to respire and grow using methanesulfonate, suggesting that they may utilize this substrate to sustain growth in ice. In addition, NO(3)(-) (2.93-3.69 $\mu$M), NH(4)(+) (1.45-3.90 $\mu$M) and PO(4)(3-) (0.01-0.75 $\mu$M) present in the ice could be potential sources fueling bacterial metabolism in this environment. It could be deduced from the study that variation in bacterial abundance and diversity was probably associated with the prevailing in situ conditions in ice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The genome sequence of the sea-ice bacterium Psychromonas ingrahamii 37, which grows exponentially at -12C, may reveal features that help to explain how this extreme psychrophile is able to grow at such low temperatures. Determination of the whole genome sequence allows comparison with genes of other psychrophiles and mesophiles. RESULTS: Correspondence analysis of the composition of all P. ingrahamii proteins showed that (1) there are 6 classes of proteins, at least one more than other bacteria, (2) integral inner membrane proteins are not sharply separated from bulk proteins suggesting that, overall, they may have a lower hydrophobic character, and (3) there is strong opposition between asparagine and the oxygen-sensitive amino acids methionine, arginine, cysteine and histidine and (4) one of the previously unseen clusters of proteins has a high proportion of "orphan" hypothetical proteins, raising the possibility these are cold-specific proteins. Based on annotation of proteins by sequence similarity, (1) P. ingrahamii has a large number (61) of regulators of cyclic GDP, suggesting that this bacterium produces an extracellular polysaccharide that may help sequester water or lower the freezing point in the vicinity of the cell. (2) P. ingrahamii has genes for production of the osmolyte, betaine choline, which may balance the osmotic pressure as sea ice freezes. (3) P. ingrahamii has a large number (11) of three-subunit TRAP systems that may play an important role in the transport of nutrients into the cell at low temperatures. (4) Chaperones and stress proteins may play a critical role in transforming nascent polypeptides into 3-dimensional configurations that permit low temperature growth. (5) Metabolic properties of P. ingrahamii were deduced. Finally, a few small sets of proteins of unknown function which may play a role in psychrophily have been singled out as worthy of future study. CONCLUSION: The results of this genomic analysis provide a springboard for further investigations into mechanisms of psychrophily. Focus on the role of asparagine excess in proteins, targeted phenotypic characterizations and gene expression investigations are needed to ascertain if and how the organism regulates various proteins in response to growth at lower temperatures.},

abstract = {Helix 69 of 23S rRNA forms one of the major inter-subunit bridges of the 70S ribosome and interacts with A- and P-site tRNAs and translation factors. Despite the proximity of h69 to the decoding center and tRNAs, the contribution of h69 to the tRNA selection process is unclear: previous genetic analyses have shown that h69 mutations increase frameshifting and readthrough of stop codons. However, a complete deletion of h69 does not affect the selection of cognate tRNAs in vitro. To address these discrepancies, the in vivo effects of a range of single- and multi-base h69 mutations in Escherichia coli 23S rRNA on various translation errors have been determined. While a majority of the h69 mutations examined here affected readthrough of stop codons and frameshifting, the DeltaA1916 single base deletion mutation uniquely influenced missense decoding. Different h69 mutants had either increased or decreased levels of stop codon readthrough. The h69 mutations that decreased UGA readthrough also decreased UGA reading by a mutant, near-cognate tRNA(Trp) carrying a G24A substitution in the D arm, but had far less effect on UGA reading by a suppressor tRNA with a complementary anticodon. These results suggest that h69 interactions with release factors contribute significantly to termination efficiency and that interaction with the D arm of A-site tRNA is important for discrimination between cognate and near-cognate tRNAs.},

Research in this field has greatly profited from recent developments in novel sequencing technologies that allow massive parallel sequencing of small RNA (sRNA) molecules, the key players of all RNA silencing phenomena. As researchers are beginning to decipher the complexity of RNA silencing, novel methodologies have to be developed to make sense of the large amounts of data that are currently being generated.

abstract = {In this feature article, we provide a side-by-side introduction for two research fields: quantum chemical calculations of molecular interaction in nucleic acids and RNA structural bioinformatics. Our main aim is to demonstrate that these research areas, while largely separated in contemporary literature, have substantial potential to complement each other that could significantly contribute to our understanding of the exciting world of nucleic acids. We identify research questions amenable to the combined application of modern ab initio methods and bioinformatics analysis of experimental structures while also assessing the limitations of these approaches. The ultimate aim is to attain valuable physicochemical insights regarding the nature of the fundamental molecular interactions and how they shape RNA structures, dynamics, function, and evolution.},

Here, we report results from a large-scale survey of the submission process, covering 923 scientific journals from the biological sciences in years 2006-2008. Manuscript flows among journals revealed a modular submission network, with high-impact journals preferentially attracting submissions. However, about 75\% of published articles were submitted first to the journal that would publish them, and high-impact journals published proportionally more articles that had been resubmitted from another journal. Submission history affected postpublication impact: Resubmissions from other journals received significantly more citations than first-intent submissions, and resubmissions between different journal communities received significantly fewer citations.},

@article{Pedraza2008,
abstract = {Many cellular components are present in such low numbers per cell that random births and deaths of individual molecules can cause substantial "noise" in concentrations. But biochemical events do not necessarily occur in single steps of individual molecules. Some processes are greatly randomized when synthesis or degradation occurs in large bursts of many molecules during a short time interval. Conversely, each birth or death of a macromolecule could involve several small steps, creating a memory between individual events. We present a generalized theory for stochastic gene expression, formulating the variance in protein abundance in terms of the randomness of the individual gene expression events. We show that common types of molecular mechanisms can produce gestation and senescence periods that reduce noise without requiring higher abundances, shorter lifetimes, or any concentration-dependent control loops. We also show that most single-cell experimental methods cannot distinguish between qualitatively different stochastic principles, although this in turn makes such methods better suited for identifying which components introduce fluctuations. Characterizing the random events that give rise to noise in concentrations instead requires dynamic measurements with single-molecule resolution.},

abstract = {A gas vacuolate bacterium, designated strain 37T, was isolated from a sea ice core collected from Point Barrow, Alaska, USA. Cells of strain 37T were large (6-14 microm in length), rod-shaped, contained gas vacuoles of two distinct morphologies, and grew well at NaCl concentrations of 1-10 \% and at temperatures of -12 to 10 degrees C. The DNA G+C content was 40 mol\%. Whole-cell fatty acid analysis showed that 16 : 1omega7c comprised 67 \% of the total fatty acid content. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that this bacterium was closely related to members of the genus Psychromonas, with highest sequence similarity (96.8 \%) to Psychromonas antarctica. Phenotypic analysis differentiated strain 37T from P. antarctica on the basis of several characteristics, including cell morphology, growth temperature range and the ability to hydrolyse polymers. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed a level of relatedness of 37 \% between strain 37T and P. antarctica, providing further support that it represents a distinct species. The name Psychromonas ingrahamii sp. nov. is proposed for this novel species. The type strain is 37T (=CCUG 51855T=CIP 108865T).},

abstract = {New RNA interaction interfaces are reported for designing RNA modules for directional supramolecular self-assembly. The new interfaces are generated from existing ones by inserting C-loops between the interaction motifs that mediate supramolecular assembly. C-Loops are new modular motifs recently identified in crystal structures that increase the helical twist of RNA helices in which they are inserted and thus reduce the distance between pairs of loop or loop-receptor motifs from 11 to 9 base-stacking layers while maintaining correct orientation for binding to cognate interaction interfaces. Binding specificities of C-loop-containing molecules for cognate molecules that also have inserted C-loops were found to range up to 20-fold. Binding affinities for most C-loop-containing molecules were generally equal or higher than those for the parent molecules lacking C-loops.},

@article{Walker1999,
abstract = {Escherichia coli Fis is a small DNA binding and bending protein that has been implicated in a variety of biological processes. A minimal promoter sequence consisting of 43 bp is sufficient to generate its characteristic growth phase-dependent expression pattern and is also subject to negative regulation by stringent control. However, information about the precise identification of nucleotides contributing to basal promoter activity and its regulation has been scant. In this work, 72 independent mutations were generated in the fis promoter (fis P) region from -108 to +78 using both random and site-directed PCR mutagenesis. beta-Galactosidase activities from mutant promoters fused to the (trp-lac)W200 fusion on a plasmid were used to conclusively identify the sequences TTTCAT and TAATAT as the -35 and -10 regions, respectively, which are optimally separated by 17 bp. We found that four consecutive substitutions within the GC-rich sequence just upstream of +1 and mutations in the -35 region, but not in the -10 region, significantly reduced the response to stringent control. Analysis of the effects of mutations on growth phase-dependent regulation showed that replacing the predominant transcription initiation nucleotide +1C with a preferred nucleotide (A or G) profoundly altered expression such that high levels of fis P mRNA were detected during late logarithmic and early stationary phases. A less dramatic effect was seen with improvements in the -10 and -35 consensus sequences. These results suggest that the acute growth phase-dependent regulation pattern observed with this promoter requires an inefficient transcription initiation process that is achieved with promoter sequences deviating from the -10 and -35 consensus sequences and, more importantly, a dependence upon the availability of the least favored transcription initiation nucleotide, CTP.},

@article{Choquet1989,
abstract = {In vitro protein synthesis in Vibrio costicola [poly(U)-directed incorporation of phenylalanine] was studied. The extent of protein synthesis was limited by the number of ribosomes present. Density gradient centrifugation experiments suggested that, after runoff of ribosomes from the artificial messenger, the 50S subunit was unable to attach to the 30S-messenger complex. As shown previously (M. Kamekura and D. J. Kushner, J. Bacteriol. 160:385-390, 1984), Cl- ions inhibited protein synthesis; indeed, the highest rate of synthesis took place in the lowest attainable Cl- concentration (37 mM). The inhibitory effects were partly reversed by glutamate and betaine, both of which are concentrated within cells of V. costicola. The strongest reversal was seen when both glutamate and betaine were present. Cl- ions can prevent binding of ribosomes to poly(U) and displace ribosomes already bound to this artificial messenger. The effects of Cl- ions on binding were also reversed by glutamate and betaine. Cl- ions did not affect accuracy of translation; they were shown previously (Kamekura and Kushner, J. Bacteriol. 160:385-390, 1984) not to affect phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. It was also found that washing ribosomes with inhibitory NaCl concentrations did not interfere with their ability to carry out protein synthesis later in optimal (low) salt concentrations. On the contrary, these ribosomes were more active than before they were washed. We conclude that the main site of action of Cl- in the system studied is on the binding of ribosomes to the mRNA.},

abstract = {DNA hybridization data (hydroxyapatite method, 50 to 70 degrees C) indicate that Rickettsia prowazekii, the type species of the type genus of the family Rickettsiaceae, is substantially less closely related to Rochalimaea species than was previously thought. The levels of relatedness of Rickettsia prowazekii to Rochalimaea species and to Bartonella bacilliformis under optimal conditions for DNA reassociation were 0 to 14\%, with 25.5\% or greater divergence in related sequences. When stringent reassociation criteria were used, the levels of relatedness were 0 to 2\%. The genera Bartonella and Rochalimaea are currently classified in different families (the Bartonellaceae and the Rickettsiaceae) in the order Rickettsiales. On the basis of DNA relatedness data, previous 16S rRNA sequence data, guanine-plus-cytosine contents, and phenotypic characteristics, neither Bartonella bacilliformis nor Rochalimaea species are closely related to other organisms currently classified in the order Rickettsiales. In fact, the closest relative of these organisms is Brucella abortus. It is therefore proposed that the family Bartonellaceae should be removed from the order Rickettsiales. Previous 16S rRNA sequence data and DNA hybridization data revealed high levels of relatedness between Bartonella bacilliformis and the four Rochalimaea species, indicating that these species are members of a single genus. It is proposed that the genus Rochalimaea should be united with the genus Bartonella in the family Bartonellaceae. The name Bartonella is retained as the genus name since it has nomenclatural priority over the name Rochalimaea. This means that new combinations for the Rochalimaea species must be created. Proposals are therefore made for the creation of Bartonella quintana comb. nov., Bartonella vinsonii comb. nov., Bartonella henselae comb. nov., and Bartonella elizabethae comb. nov.},

The novel isolate, designated T-16X(T), produced spherical or ellipsoidal endospores in a non-bulging or slightly swollen sporangium in a terminal position and survived in a medium containing up to 450 mM boron. Whereas it tolerated 11 \% (w/v) NaCl, it also grew without NaCl or boron. The temperature range for growth was 16-37 degrees C (optimum 25-28 degrees C) and the pH range for growth was 6.0-10.0 (optimum pH 7.5-8.5). The DNA G+C content was 35.8 mol\% and the major cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0) and anteiso-C(15 : 0) at 18.2 and 45.7 \% of the total fatty acids, respectively. MK-7 (90 \%) was the predominant respiratory quinone system and meso-diaminopimelic acid was the predominant diamino acid of the cell-wall peptidoglycan. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the novel strain is closely related to the type strains of Gracilibacillus orientalis (96.7 \% similarity), G. halotolerans (95.5 \%) and G. dipsosauri (95.4 \%). However, the maximum DNA hybridization value for this strain with these closely related strains was less than 26.2 \%. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence data and chemotaxonomic and physiological features, the organism T-16X(T) (=DSM 17256(T)=IAM 15263(T)=ATCC BAA-1190(T)) is proposed to be a member of the genus Gracilibacillus as the type strain of the novel species Gracilibacillus boraciitolerans sp. nov.},

abstract = {A group of nine Gram-positive endospore-forming bacteria was isolated from soil of the Drentse A agricultural research area in The Netherlands. Using (GTG)5-PCR genomic fingerprinting and fatty acid analysis, the nine isolates were divided into three consistent groups. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of representative strains, the nine isolates were shown to belong to the genus Bacillus. The first group of four isolates was most closely related to Bacillus carboniphilus (95.5 \%) and Bacillus sporothermodurans (95.5 \%). The second and third groups of three and two isolates, respectively, showed highest sequence similarity to Bacillus neidei (97.0 and 97.1 \%, respectively) and Bacillus pycnus (both 96.7 \%). A DNA-DNA relatedness study confirmed the consistency of the three groups delineated by (GTG)5-PCR and fatty acid analysis. A small number of phenotypic characters allowed differentiation of the three groups of isolates. The three groups therefore represent novel species, for which the names Bacillus humi, Bacillus arenosi and Bacillus arvi are proposed, with LMG 22167T (=DSM 16318T), LMG 22166T (=DSM 16319T) and LMG 22165T (=DSM 16317T) as the respective type strains.},

abstract = {Consortia containing a novel coccus-shaped, anaerobic heterotroph together with Pyrobaculum rods were cultivated from geothermal environments in New Zealand. Pure cultures of the cocci were only obtained from one such consortium, despite extensive attempts. Cells of this strain (AQ1.S1T) were regular to irregular cocci in morphology and occasionally formed large aggregates, especially when utilizing polysaccharides such as konjac glucomannan as a carbon source. Strain AQ1.S1T is a hyperthermophile, with an optimal temperature for growth between 92 and 95 degrees C (range 85-98 degrees C), and a moderate acidophile, with optimal growth occurring at pH 6.4 (range 5.4-7.0). Growth was inhibited by the addition of sulphur and NaCl (optimal growth occurred without addition of NaCl) and an electron acceptor was not required. Strain AQ1.S1T utilized starch, trypticase peptone, lactose, glucose, konjac glucomannan, mannose, galactose, maltose, glycogen and beta-cyclodextrin as carbon sources. The G+C content was 52.9 mol\%. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and physiological features it is proposed that isolate AQ1.S1T (=DSM 17230T=JCM 13409T) represents the type strain of a novel species of a new genus within the Crenarchaeota, Ignisphaera aggregans gen. nov., sp. nov.},

abstract = {Pseudouridine at position 55 ($\Psi$55) in eubacterial tRNA is produced by TruB. To clarify the role of the $\Psi$55 modification, we constructed a truB gene disruptant ($\Delta$truB) strain of Thermus thermophilus which is an extreme-thermophilic eubacterium. Unexpectedly, the $\Delta$truB strain exhibited severe growth retardation at 50 °C. We assumed that these phenomena might be caused by lack of RNA chaperone activity of TruB, which was previously hypothetically proposed by others. To confirm this idea, we replaced the truB gene in the genome with mutant genes, which express TruB proteins with very weak or no enzymatic activity. However the growth retardation at 50 °C was not rescued by these mutant proteins. Nucleoside analysis revealed that Gm18, m(5)s(2)U54 and m(1)A58 in tRNA from the $\Delta$truB strain were abnormally increased. An in vitro assay using purified tRNA modification enzymes demonstrated that the $\Psi$55 modification has a negative effect on Gm18 formation by TrmH. These experimental results show that the $\Psi$55 modification is required for low-temperature adaptation to control other modified. (35)S-Met incorporation analysis showed that the protein synthesis activity of the $\Delta$truB strain was inferior to that of the wild-type strain and that the cold-shock proteins were absence in the $\Delta$truB cells at 50°C.},

abstract = {The structures of ribosomal proteins and their interactions with RNA have been examined in the refined crystal structure of the Haloarcula marismortui large ribosomal subunit. The protein structures fall into six groups based on their topology. The 50S subunit proteins function primarily to stabilize inter-domain interactions that are necessary to maintain the subunit's structural integrity. An extraordinary variety of protein-RNA interactions is observed. Electrostatic interactions between numerous arginine and lysine residues, particularly those in tail extensions, and the phosphate groups of the RNA backbone mediate many protein-RNA contacts. Base recognition occurs via both the minor groove and widened major groove of RNA helices, as well as through hydrophobic binding pockets that capture bulged nucleotides and through insertion of amino acid residues into hydrophobic crevices in the RNA. Primary binding sites on contiguous RNA are identified for 20 of the 50S ribosomal proteins, which along with few large protein-protein interfaces, suggest the order of assembly for some proteins and that the protein extensions fold cooperatively with RNA. The structure supports the hypothesis of co-transcriptional assembly, centered around L24 in domain I. Finally, comparing the structures and locations of the 50S ribosomal proteins from H.marismortui and D.radiodurans revealed striking examples of molecular mimicry. These comparisons illustrate that identical RNA structures can be stabilized by unrelated proteins.},

abstract = {RNA tertiary motifs play an important role in RNA folding and biochemical functions. To help interpret the complex organization of RNA tertiary interactions, we comprehensively analyze a data set of 54 high-resolution RNA crystal structures for motif occurrence and correlations. Specifically, we search seven recognized categories of RNA tertiary motifs (coaxial helix, A-minor, ribose zipper, pseudoknot, kissing hairpin, tRNA D-loop/T-loop, and tetraloop-tetraloop receptor) by various computer programs. For the nonredundant RNA data set, we find 613 RNA tertiary interactions, most of which occur in the 16S and 23S rRNAs. An analysis of these motifs reveals the diversity and variety of A-minor motif interactions and the various possible loop-loop receptor interactions that expand upon the tetraloop-tetraloop receptor. Correlations between motifs, such as pseudoknot or coaxial helix with A-minor, reveal higher-order patterns. These findings may ultimately help define tertiary structure restraints for RNA tertiary structure prediction. A complete annotation of the RNA diagrams for our data set is available at http://www.biomath.nyu.edu/motifs/.},

In this work, the largest coevolving RNA/protein signatures in the bacterial 30S ribosome are investigated both experimentally and computationally through all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations. The complex includes the N-terminal fragment of the ribosomal protein S4, which is a primary binding protein that initiates 30S small subunit assembly from the 5' domain, and helix 16 (h16), which is part of the five-way junction in 16S rRNA. Our results show that the S4 N-terminus signature is intrinsically disordered in solution, whereas h16 is relatively stable by itself. The dynamic disordered property of the protein is exploited to couple the folding and binding process to the five-way junction, and the results provide insight into the mechanism for the early and fast binding of S4 in the assembly of the ribosomal small subunit.},

We calibrated this model using results from high precision single molecule nucleosome unzipping experiments, and then tested its predictions for experiments in which nucleosomes are disassembled by the DNA mismatch recognition complex hMSH2-hMSH6. We found that this calibrated model quantitatively describes hMSH2-hMSH6 induced disassembly rates of nucleosomes with two separate DNA sequences and four distinct histone modification states. In addition, this model provides mechanistic insight into nucleosome disassembly by hMSH2-hMSH6 and the influence of histone modifications on this disassembly reaction. This model's precise agreement with current experiments suggests that it can be applied more generally to provide important mechanistic understanding of the numerous nucleosome alterations that occur during DNA processing.},

These include (a) a model at the atomic level of the network of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions that recruit RNA polymerase to rRNA promoters, accounting for their extraordinary strength; (b) discovery of the nonredundant roles of two small molecule effectors, ppGpp and the initiating NTP, in regulation of rRNA transcription initiation; and (c) identification of a new component of the transcription machinery, DksA, that is absolutely required for regulation of rRNA promoter activity. Together, these advances provide clues important for our molecular understanding not only of rRNA transcription, but also of transcription in general.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Understanding the details of protein-RNA interactions is important to reveal the functions of both the RNAs and the proteins. In these interactions the secondary structures of the RNAs play an important role. Because RNA secondary structures in protein-RNA complexes are variable, considering the ensemble of RNA secondary structures is a useful approach. In particular, recent studies have supported the idea that, in the analysis of RNA secondary structures, the base-pairing probabilities of RNAs (i.e., the probabilities of forming a base-pair in the ensemble of RNA secondary structures) provide richer and more robust information about the structures than a single RNA secondary structure, for example, the minimum free energy (MFE) structure or a snapshot of structures in the PDB. However, there has been no investigation of the base-paring probabilities in protein-RNA interactions.

RESULTS: In this study, we analyzed base-pairing probabilities of RNA molecules involved in known protein-RNA complexes in the PDB. Our analysis suggests that, in the tertiary structures, the base-pairing probabilities (which are computed using only sequence information) for unpaired nucleotides with intermolecular hydrogen bonds to amino acids were significantly lower than those for unpaired nucleotides without hydrogen bonds. On the other hand, no difference was found between the base-pairing probabilities for paired nucleotides with and without intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Those findings were commonly supported by three probabilistic models, which provide the ensemble of RNA secondary structures, including the McCaskill model based on Turner's free energy of secondary structures.

abstract = {Two strains (Gsoil 492(T) and Gsoil 643(T)) isolated in Pocheon Province, South Korea, from soil used for ginseng cultivation were characterized using a polyphasic approach. Both isolates comprised Gram-negative, aerobic, non-motile, rod-shaped bacteria. They had similar chemotaxonomic characteristics, e.g. containing MK-7 as the major quinone, having a DNA G+C content in the range 42.5-43.3 mol\% and possessing iso-C(15 : 0) and iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH as the major fatty acids. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the two isolates formed a tight cluster with several uncultured bacterial clones and with the established genera Terrimonas, Niastella and Chitinophaga in the phylum Bacteroidetes but were clearly separate from these genera. The levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between the isolates and type strains of related genera ranged from 87.5 to 92.4 \%. Furthermore, the results of physiological and biochemical tests allowed phenotypic differentiation of the isolates from phylogenetically closely related species with validly published names. The level of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between the two strains was 99.5 \%, whereas the DNA-DNA relatedness value was 44 \%, indicating that they represent separate species. On the basis of the polyphasic evidence, a novel genus, Flavisolibacter gen. nov., and two novel species, Flavisolibacter ginsengiterrae sp. nov. (type strain Gsoil 492(T)=KCTC 12656(T)=DSM 18136(T)) and Flavisolibacter ginsengisoli sp. nov. (type strain Gsoil 643(T)=KCTC 12657(T)=DSM 18119(T)), are proposed. Flavisolibacter ginsengiterrae is the type species of the genus.},

abstract = {We have investigated the effect of reduced water activity on the pressure-stability of double-stranded DNA polymers, poly[d(A-T)] and poly[d(I-C)]. Water activity was modulated by the addition of ethylene glycol and glycerol. The ionic strength of the medium was such that pressure had a destabilising effect on the polymers in the absence of cosolvents. The molar volume change of the heat-induced helix to coil transition (DeltaV(T)) becomes more positive as the activity of water was reduced, suggesting that the pressure-induced denaturation of DNA polymers would not occur at very low water activity. This would imply that water plays a crucial role in the pressure denaturation of DNA, much like that in pressure denaturation of proteins where the driving force of the process is the penetration of water molecules into the protein core [Hummer et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1998, 95, 1552-1555].},

abstract = {The standard sodium concentration for RNA optical melting experiments is 1.021 M. Algorithms that predict Tm, $\Delta$G°37, and secondary structure from sequence generally rely on parameters derived from optical melting experiments performed in 1.021 M sodium. Physiological monovalent cation concentrations are much lower than 1.021 M. In fact, many molecular biology techniques require buffers containing monovalent cation concentrations other than 1.021 M. Predictions based on the 1.021 M Na(+) parameters may not be accurate when the monovalent cation concentration is not 1.021 M. Here, we report thermodynamic data from optical melting experiments for a set of 18 RNA duplexes, each melted over a wide range of sodium ion concentrations (71, 121, 221, and 621 mM). Using these data and previously published data for the same sequences melted in 1.021 M Na(+), we report Tm and $\Delta$G°37 correction factors to scale the standard 1.021 M Na(+) RNA parameters to other sodium ion concentrations. The recommended Tm correction factor predicts the melting temperature within 0.7 °C, and the recommended $\Delta$G°37 correction factor predicts the free energy within 0.14 kcal/mol. These correction factors can be incorporated into prediction algorithms that predict RNA secondary structure from sequence and provide Tm and $\Delta$G°37 values for RNA duplexes.},

abstract = {The effects of temperature and carbon substrate availability on the stimulation of sulfate reduction by indigenous populations of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRP) in permanently ice-covered Lake Fryxell, Antarctica were investigated. Psychrophilic and halotolerant, lactate-degrading SRP showed significant metabolic activity throughout all sampled depths of the water column, suggesting that such organisms, possibly of marine origin, may be key contributors to carbon and sulfur cycling in Lake Fryxell. Planktonic and benthic strains of lactate-oxidizing sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were isolated from samples of various depths of the anoxic water column and from surficial sediments. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences placed the Fryxell sulfate-reducer (FSR) strains within the Deltaproteobacteria and showed them to be most closely related to the Arctic marine species of SRB Desulfovibrio frigidus and Desulfovibrio ferrireducens. Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic differences between the Antarctic FSR strains and related species of the genus Desulfovibrio, strain FSRs(T) (=DSM 23315(T) =ATCC BAA-2083(T)) is proposed as the type strain of a novel species of cold-active SRB, Desulfovibrio lacusfryxellense, sp. nov.},

abstract = {We carried out a comprehensive survey of small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences from archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic lineages in order to understand the general patterns of thermal adaptation in the rRNA genes. Within each lineage, we compared sequences from mesophilic, moderately thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic species. We carried out a more detailed study of the archaea, because of the wide range of growth temperatures within this group. Our results confirmed that there is a clear correlation between the GC content of the paired stem regions of the 16S rRNA genes and the optimal growth temperature, and we show that this correlation cannot be explained simply by phylogenetic relatedness among the thermophilic archaeal species. In addition, we found a significant, positive relationship between rRNA stem length and growth temperature. These correlations are found in both bacterial and archaeal rRNA genes. Finally, we compared rRNA sequences from warm-blooded and cold-blooded vertebrates. We found that, while rRNA sequences from the warm-blooded vertebrates have a higher overall GC content than those from the cold-blooded vertebrates, this difference is not concentrated in the paired regions of the molecule, suggesting that thermal adaptation is not the cause of the nucleotide differences between the vertebrate lineages.},

abstract = {Parasites that exploit multiple hosts often experience diversifying selection for host-specific adaptations. This can result in multiple strains of host specialists coexisting within a single parasitic species. A long-standing conundrum is how such sympatric host races can be maintained within a single parasitic species in the face of interbreeding among conspecifics specializing on different hosts. Striking examples are seen in certain avian brood parasites such as cuckoos, many of which show host-specific differentiation in traits such as host egg mimicry. Exploiting a Zambian egg collection amassed over several decades and supplemented by recent fieldwork, we show that the brood parasitic Greater Honeyguide Indicator indicator exhibits host-specific differentiation in both egg size and egg shape. Genetic analysis of honeyguide eggs and chicks show that two highly divergent mitochondrial DNA lineages are associated with ground- and tree-nesting hosts, respectively, indicating perfect fidelity to two mutually exclusive sets of host species for millions of years. Despite their age and apparent adaptive diversification, however, these ancient lineages are not cryptic species; a complete lack of differentiation in nuclear genes shows that mating between individuals reared by different hosts is sufficiently frequent to prevent speciation. These results indicate that host specificity is maternally inherited, that host-specific adaptation among conspecifics can be maintained without reproductive isolation, and that host specificity can be remarkably ancient in evolutionary terms.},

abstract = {We seek to understand the link between protein thermodynamics and protein structure in molecular detail. A classical approach to this problem involves assessing changes in protein stability resulting from added cosolvents. Under any given conditions, protein molecules in aqueous buffer are in equilibrium between unfolded and folded states, U(nfolded) <==> N(ative). Addition of organic osmolytes, small uncharged compounds found throughout nature, shift this equilibrium. Urea, a denaturing osmolyte, shifts the equilibrium toward U; trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a protecting osmolyte, shifts the equilibrium toward N. Using the Tanford Transfer Model, the thermodynamic response to many such osmolytes has been dissected into groupwise free energy contributions. It is found that the energetics involving backbone hydrogen bonding controls these shifts in protein stability almost entirely, with osmolyte cosolvents simply dialing between solvent-backbone versus backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds, as a function of solvent quality. This reciprocal relationship establishes the essential link between protein thermodynamics and the protein's hydrogen-bonded backbone structure.},

@article{Christensen2001,
abstract = {The stringent response is defined as the physiological changes elicited by amino acid starvation. Many of these changes depend on the regulatory nucleotide ppGpp (guanosine tetraphosphate) synthesized by RelA (ppGpp synthetase I), the relA-encoded protein. The second rel locus of Escherichia coli is called relBE and encodes RelE cytotoxin and RelB antitoxin. RelB counteracts the toxic effect of RelE. In addition, RelB is an autorepressor of relBE transcription. Here we reveal a ppGpp-independent mechanism that reduces the level of translation during amino acid starvation. Artificial overexpression of RelE severely inhibited translation. During amino acid starvation, the presence of relBE caused a significant reduction in the poststarvation level of translation. Concomitantly, relBE transcription was rapidly and strongly induced. Induction of transcription occurred independently of relA and spoT (encoding ppGpp synthetase II), but instead depended on Lon protease. Consistently, Lon was required for degradation of RelB. Replacement of the relBE promoter with a LacI-regulated promoter indicated that strong and ongoing transcription of relBE is required to maintain a proper RelB:RelE ratio during starvation. Thus relBE may be regarded as a previously uncharacterized type of stress-response element that reduces the global level of translation during nutritional stress.},

abstract = {Mutational events as well as the selection of the optimal variant are essential steps in the evolution of living organisms. The same principle is used in laboratory to extend the natural biodiversity to obtain better catalysts for applications in biomanufacturing or for improved biopharmaceuticals. Furthermore, single mutation in genes of drug-metabolizing enzymes can also result in dramatic changes in pharmacokinetics. These changes are a major cause of patient-specific drug responses and are, therefore, the molecular basis for personalized medicine. MuteinDB systematically links laboratory-generated enzyme variants (muteins) and natural isoforms with their biochemical properties including kinetic data of catalyzed reactions. Detailed information about kinetic characteristics of muteins is available in a systematic way and searchable for known mutations and catalyzed reactions as well as their substrates and known products. MuteinDB is broadly applicable to any known protein and their variants and makes mutagenesis and biochemical data searchable and comparable in a simple and easy-to-use manner. For the import of new mutein data, a simple, standardized, spreadsheet-based data format has been defined.

abstract = {The current paradigm on the nature of viruses is based on early work of the 'phage group' (the pro-phage concept) and molecular biologists working on tumour viruses (the proto-oncogene concept). It posits that viruses evolved from either prokaryotic or eukaryotic cellular genes that became infectious via their association with capsid genes. In this view, after their emergence viruses continued to evolve by stealing cellular genes (the escape model). This paradigm has been challenged recently by scientists who propose that viruses pre-dated modern cells. In particular, the discovery of Mimivirus has stimulated a lot of discussions on the nature of viruses. There are two major schools of thought, those who defend the escape model, suggesting that giant viruses are giant pickpockets (chimera), and those who emphasize their uniqueness and ancient origin. Comparative genomics of Mimivirus and related viruses (nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses) have produced a lot of data that have been interpreted according to the prejudices of the authors and thus failed until now to generate a consensus. I briefly review here the history of these debates and how they lead to new proposals, such as the definition of viruses as capsid-encoding organisms or else the recognition of their fundamentally cellular nature, the virocell concept.},

@article{McCoy2011,
abstract = {The key role of the bacterial ribosome makes it an important target for antibacterial agents. Indeed, a large number of clinically useful antibiotics target this complex translational ribonucleoprotein machinery. The majority of these compounds, mostly of natural origin, bind to one of the three key ribosomal sites: the decoding (or A-site) on the 30S, the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) on the 50S, and the peptide exit tunnel on the 50S. Antibiotics that bind the A-site, such as the aminoglycosides, interfere with codon recognition and translocation. Peptide bond formation is inhibited when small molecules like oxazolidinones bind at the PTC. Finally, macrolides tend to block the growth of the amino acid chain at the peptide exit tunnel. In this article, the major classes of antibiotics that target the bacterial ribosome are discussed and classified according to their respective target. Notably, most antibiotics solely interact with the RNA components of the bacterial ribosome. The surge seen in the appearance of resistant bacteria has not been met by a parallel development of effective and broad-spectrum new antibiotics, as evident by the introduction of only two novel classes of antibiotics, the oxazolidinones and lipopeptides, in the past decades. Nevertheless, this significant health threat has revitalized the search for new antibacterial agents and novel targets. High resolution structural data of many ribosome-bound antibiotics provide unprecedented insight into their molecular contacts and mode of action and inspire the design and synthesis of new candidate drugs that target this fascinating molecular machine.},

abstract = {Many RNAs do not directly code proteins but are nonetheless indispensable to cellular function. These strands fold into intricate three-dimensional shapes that are essential structures in protein synthesis, splicing, and many other processes of gene regulation and expression. A variety of biophysical and biochemical methods are now showing, in real time, how ribosomal subunits and other ribonucleoprotein complexes assemble from their molecular components. Footprinting methods are particularly useful for studying the folding of long RNAs: they provide quantitative information about the conformational state of each residue and require little material. Data from footprinting complement the global information available from small-angle X-ray scattering or cryo-electron microscopy, as well as the dynamic information derived from single-molecule F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and NMR methods. In this Account, I discuss how we have used hydroxyl radical footprinting and other experimental methods to study pathways of RNA folding and 30S ribosome assembly. Hydroxyl radical footprinting probes the solvent accessibility of the RNA backbone at each residue in as little as 10 ms, providing detailed views of RNA folding pathways in real time. In conjunction with other methods such as solution scattering and single-molecule FRET, time-resolved footprinting of ribozymes showed that stable domains of RNA tertiary structure fold in less than 1 s. However, the free energy landscapes for RNA folding are rugged, and individual molecules kinetically partition into folding pathways that lead through metastable intermediates, stalling the folding or assembly process. Time-resolved footprinting was used to follow the formation of tertiary structure and protein interactions in the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) during the assembly of 30S ribosomes. As previously observed in much simpler ribozymes, assembly occurs in stages, with individual molecules taking different routes to the final complex. Interactions occur concurrently in all domains of the 16S rRNA, and multistage protection of binding sites of individual proteins suggests that initial encounter complexes between the rRNA and ribosomal proteins are remodeled during assembly. Equilibrium footprinting experiments showed that one primary binding protein was sufficient to stabilize the tertiary structure of the entire 16S 5'-domain. The rich detail available from the footprinting data showed that the secondary assembly protein S16 suppresses non-native structures in the 16S 5'-domain. In doing so, S16 enables a conformational switch distant from its own binding site, which may play a role in establishing interactions with other domains of the 30S subunit. Together, the footprinting results show how protein-induced changes in RNA structure are communicated over long distances, ensuring cooperative assembly of even very large RNA-protein complexes such as the ribosome.},

The protein elongation cycle, during which the tRNAs traverse the ribosome in a coordinated manner along a path of more than 100 A, is facilitated by large-scale rearrangements of the ribosome. These rearrangements go hand in hand with conformational changes of tRNA as well as elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G - GTPases that catalyze tRNA delivery and translocation, respectively. This review focuses on the structural data related to the dynamics of the ribosomal machinery, which are the basis, in conjunction with existing biochemical, kinetic, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer data, of our knowledge of the decoding and translocation steps of protein elongation.},

The first structure identified in a protein family enables inference of the fold and of ancient relationships to other proteins; in the year ending 31 January 2005, about half of such structures were solved at a SG center rather than in a traditional laboratory. Furthermore, the cost of solving a structure at the most efficient SG center in the United States has dropped to one-quarter of the estimated cost of solving a structure by traditional methods. However, the efficiency of the top structural biology laboratories-even though they work on very challenging structures-is comparable to that of SG centers; moreover, traditional structural biology papers are cited significantly more often, suggesting greater current impact.},

abstract = {The UP element, a component of bacterial promoters located upstream of the -35 hexamer, increases transcription by interacting with the RNA polymerase alpha-subunit. By using a modification of the SELEX procedure for identification of protein-binding sites, we selected in vitro and subsequently screened in vivo for sequences that greatly increased promoter activity when situated upstream of the Escherichia coli rrnB P1 core promoter. A set of 31 of these upstream sequences increased transcription from 136- to 326-fold in vivo, considerably more than the natural rrnB P1 UP element, and was used to derive a consensus sequence: -59 nnAAA(A/T)(A/T)T(A/T)TTTTnnAAAAnnn -38. The most active selected sequence contained the derived consensus, displayed all of the properties of an UP element, and the interaction of this sequence with the alpha C-terminal domain was similar to that of previously characterized UP elements. The identification of the UP element consensus should facilitate a detailed understanding of the alpha-DNA interaction. Based on the evolutionary conservation of the residues in alpha responsible for interaction with UP elements, we suggest that the UP element consensus sequence should be applicable throughout eubacteria, should generally facilitate promoter prediction, and may be of use for biotechnological applications.},

Only 5 of the 20 usual amino acid residues, Asn, Gln, Asp, Glu and Arg, are able to orient in a coplanar fashion in order to form pseudo pairs with nucleotide bases through two hydrogen bonds. The peptide backbone can also form pseudo pairs with nucleotide bases and presents a strong bias for binding to the adenine base. The Watson-Crick side of the nucleotide bases is the major interaction edge participating in such pseudo pairs. Pseudo pairs between the Watson-Crick edge of guanine and Asp are frequently observed. The Hoogsteen edge of the purine bases is a good discriminatory element in recognition of nucleotide bases by protein side chains through the pseudo pairing: the Hoogsteen edge of adenine is recognized by various amino acids while the Hoogsteen edge of guanine is only recognized by Arg. The sugar edge is rarely recognized by either the side-chain or peptide backbone of amino acid residues.},

A number of algorithms have been developed to predict RNA secondary structure. Their performance has been benchmarked by comparing structure predictions to reference secondary structures. Generally, algorithms are compared against each other and one is selected as best without statistical testing to determine whether the improvement is significant. In this work, it is demonstrated that the prediction accuracies of methods correlate with each other over sets of sequences. One possible reason for this correlation is that many algorithms use the same underlying principles. A set of benchmarks published previously for programs that predict a structure common to three or more sequences is statistically analyzed as an example to show that it can be rigorously evaluated using paired two-sample t-tests. Finally, a pipeline of statistical analyses is proposed to guide the choice of data set size and performance assessment for benchmarks of structure prediction. The pipeline is applied using 5S rRNA sequences as an example.},

RhlB, the RNA helicase component of the degradosome, also contributes to ribosome binding, and this is favoured through an activating interaction with RNase E. The catalytic activity of RNase E for processing 9S RNA (the ribosomal 5S RNA precursor) is repressed in the presence of the ribosome, whereas there is little affect on the cleavage of single-stranded substrates mediated by non-coding RNA, suggestings that the enzyme retains capacity to cleave unstructured substrates when associated with the ribosome. We propose that polysomes may act as antennae that enhance the rates of capture of the limited number of degradosomes, so that they become recruited to sites of active translation to act on mRNAs as they become exposed or tagged for degradation.},

abstract = {The present study explores the dramatic projection of one's own views onto those of Jesus among conservative and liberal American Christians. In a large-scale survey, the relevant views that each group attributed to a contemporary Jesus differed almost as much as their own views. Despite such dissonance-reducing projection, however, conservatives acknowledged the relevant discrepancy with regard to "fellowship" issues (e.g., taxation to reduce economic inequality and treatment of immigrants) and liberals acknowledged the relevant discrepancy with regard to "morality" issues (e.g., abortion and gay marriage). However, conservatives also claimed that a contemporary Jesus would be even more conservative than themselves on the former issues whereas liberals claimed that Jesus would be even more liberal than themselves on the latter issues. Further reducing potential dissonance, liberal and conservative Christians differed markedly in the types of issues they claimed to be more central to their faith. A concluding discussion considers the relationship between individual motivational processes and more social processes that may underlie the present findings, as well as implications for contemporary social and political conflict.},

abstract = {Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and their associated genes are linked to a mechanism of acquired resistance against bacteriophages. Bacteria can integrate short stretches of phage-derived sequences (spacers) within CRISPR loci to become phage resistant. In this study, we further characterized the efficiency of CRISPR1 as a phage resistance mechanism in Streptococcus thermophilus. First, we show that CRISPR1 is distinct from previously known phage defense systems and is effective against the two main groups of S. thermophilus phages. Analyses of 30 bacteriophage-insensitive mutants of S. thermophilus indicate that the addition of one new spacer in CRISPR1 is the most frequent outcome of a phage challenge and that the iterative addition of spacers increases the overall phage resistance of the host. The added new spacers have a size of between 29 to 31 nucleotides, with 30 being by far the most frequent. Comparative analysis of 39 newly acquired spacers with the complete genomic sequences of the wild-type phages 2972, 858, and DT1 demonstrated that the newly added spacer must be identical to a region (named proto-spacer) in the phage genome to confer a phage resistance phenotype. Moreover, we found a CRISPR1-specific sequence (NNAGAAW) located downstream of the proto-spacer region that is important for the phage resistance phenotype. Finally, we show through the analyses of 20 mutant phages that virulent phages are rapidly evolving through single nucleotide mutations as well as deletions, in response to CRISPR1.},

abstract = {the evolution of generalists. Here we explored the phenotypic and molecular changes associated with evolving an RNA virus in constant versus fluctuating temperature environments. We used vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) to determine whether selection at a constant temperature entails a performance trade-off at an unselected temperature, whether virus populations evolve to be generalists when selected in deterministically changing temperature environments, and whether selection under stochastically changing temperatures prevents evolved generalization, such as by constraining the ability for viruses to adaptively improve. We observed that all VSV lineages evolved at constant temperatures showed fitness gains in their selected temperature with little evidence for trade-offs in performance in the unselected environment. Evolution in deterministically and stochastically changing temperatures led to populations with the highest and lowest overall fitness gains, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed little evidence for convergent molecular evolution among lineages within the same treatment. Across all temperature treatments, the majority of genome substitutions occurred in the G (glycoprotein) gene, suggesting that this locus for the cell-binding protein plays a key role in dictating VSV performance under changing temperature.},

abstract = {The molecular basis of the induced-fit mechanism that determines the fidelity of protein synthesis remains unclear. Here, we isolated mutations in 16S rRNA that increase the rate of miscoding and stop codon read-through. Many of the mutations clustered along interfaces between the 30S shoulder domain and other parts of the ribosome, strongly implicating shoulder movement in the induced-fit mechanism of decoding. The largest subset of mutations mapped to helices h8 and h14. These helices interact with each other and with the 50S subunit to form bridge B8. Previous cryo-EM studies revealed a contact between h14 and the switch 1 motif of EF-Tu, raising the possibility that h14 plays a direct role in GTPase activation. To investigate this possibility, we constructed both deletions and insertions in h14. While ribosomes harboring a 2-base-pair (bp) insertion in h14 were completely inactive in vivo, those containing a 2-bp deletion retained activity but were error prone. In vitro, the truncation of h14 accelerated GTP hydrolysis for EF-Tu bearing near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA, an effect that can largely account for the observed miscoding in vivo. These data show that h14 does not help activate EF-Tu but instead negatively controls GTP hydrolysis by the factor. We propose that bridge B8 normally acts to counter inward rotation of the shoulder domain; hence, mutations in h8 and h14 that compromise this bridge decrease the stringency of aminoacyl-tRNA selection.},

The cells were regular cocci, 1-4 microm in diameter, with one long flagellum. The cell envelope was composed of a globular layer attached to the cytoplasmic membrane. The temperature range for growth was 63-89 degrees C, with an optimum between 80 and 82 degrees C. The pH range for growth at 80 degrees C was 4.8-6.8, with an optimum at pH 6.0. Strain Z-1312(T) grew by hydrolysis and/or fermentation of a wide range of polymeric and monomeric substrates, including agarose, amygdalin, arabinose, arbutin, casein hydrolysate, cellulose (filter paper, microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose), dextran, dulcitol, fructose, lactose, laminarin, lichenan, maltose, pectin, peptone, ribose, starch and sucrose. No growth was detected on glucose, xylose, mannitol or sorbitol. Growth products when sucrose or starch were used as the substrate were acetate, H(2) and CO(2). Elemental sulfur, thiosulfate and nitrate added as potential electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration did not stimulate growth when tested with starch as the substrate. H(2) at 100 \% in the gas phase did not inhibit growth on starch or peptone. The G+C content of the DNA was 42.5 mol\%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis placed the isolated strain Z-1312(T) as a member of the genus Desulfurococcus, where it represented a novel species, for which the name Desulfurococcus fermentans sp. nov. (type strain Z-1312(T) = DSM 16532 (T) = VKM V-2316(T)) is proposed.},

abstract = {Three base pairs in the T-stem are primarily responsible for the sequence-specific interaction of tRNA with Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus EF-Tu. While the amino acids on the surface of EF-Tu that contact aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) are highly conserved among bacteria, the T-stem sequences of individual tRNA are variable, making it unclear whether or not this protein-nucleic acid interaction is also sequence specific in other bacteria. We propose and validate a thermodynamic model that predicts the $\Delta$G° of any tRNA to EF-Tu using the sequence of its three T-stem base pairs. Despite dramatic differences in T-stem sequences, the predicted $\Delta$G° values for the majority of tRNA classes are similar in all bacteria and closely match the $\Delta$G° values determined for E. coli tRNAs. Each individual tRNA class has evolved to have a characteristic $\Delta$G° value to EF-Tu, but different T-stem sequences are used to achieve this $\Delta$G° value in different bacteria. Thus, the compensatory relationship between the affinity of the tRNA body and the affinity of the esterified amino acid is universal among bacteria. Additionally, we predict and validate a small number of aa-tRNAs that bind more weakly to EF-Tu than expected and thus are candidates for acting as activated amino acid donors in processes outside of translation.},

From the results of taxonomic studies, all of these isolates have been identified as strains of Shewanella benthica except for strain DSS12. Strain DSS12 is a member of a novel, moderately barophilic Shewanella species isolated from the Ryukyu Trench at a depth of 5,110 m. On Marine Agar 2216 plates, this organism produced a violet pigment, whereas the colonies of other isolates (S. benthica) were rose-colored. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequences showed that strain DSS12 represents a separate lineage within the genus Shewanella that is closely related to S. benthica and particularly to the members of the Shewanella barophiles branch. The temperature range for growth and some of the biochemical characteristics indicate that strain DSS12 differs from other Shewanella species. Furthermore, strain DSS12 displayed a low level of DNA similarity to the Shewanella type strains. Based on these differences, it is proposed that strain DSS12 represents a new deep-sea Shewanella species. The name Shewanella violacea (JCM 10179) is proposed.},

abstract = {Cultivation-independent molecular phylogenetic techniques are now widely employed to examine environmental microbial diversity; however, the relationship between microbial community structure and ecosystem function is unclear. This review synthesizes cultivation-independent views of microbiological diversity with our current understanding of nutrient dynamics in alpine and arctic soils. Recently, we have begun to explore connections between microbial community structure and function in soils from the alpine Niwot Ridge LTER site in Colorado, USA, whose ecology has been extensively investigated for over 50 years. We examined the diversity of bacterial, eucaryal, and archaeal small subunit rRNA genes in tundra and talus soils across seasons in the alpine. This work has provided support for spatial and seasonal shifts in specific microbial groups, which correlate well with previously documented transitions in microbial processes. In addition, these preliminary results suggest that the physiologies of certain groups of organisms may scale up to the ecosystem level, providing the basis for testable hypotheses about the function of specific microbes in this system. These studies have also expanded on the known diversity of life, as these soils harbor bacterial and eucaryotic lineages that are distantly related to other known organisms. In contrast to the alpine, microbial diversity in the arctic has been little explored; only three published studies have used molecular techniques to examine these soils. Because of the importance of these systems, particularly to the global C cycle, and their vulnerability to current and impending climate change, the microbial diversity of these soils needs to be further investigated.},

Modern calorimeters are sensitive enough to probe even weak biological interactions making ITC a very popular method among biochemists. Although ITC has been applied to protein studies for many years, it is becoming widely applicable in RNA biochemistry as well, especially in studies which involve RNA folding and RNA interactions with small molecules, proteins and with other RNAs.

abstract = {In this work we develop a microscopic physical model of early evolution where phenotype--organism life expectancy--is directly related to genotype--the stability of its proteins in their native conformations-which can be determined exactly in the model. Simulating the model on a computer, we consistently observe the "Big Bang" scenario whereby exponential population growth ensues as soon as favorable sequence-structure combinations (precursors of stable proteins) are discovered. Upon that, random diversity of the structural space abruptly collapses into a small set of preferred proteins. We observe that protein folds remain stable and abundant in the population at timescales much greater than mutation or organism lifetime, and the distribution of the lifetimes of dominant folds in a population approximately follows a power law. The separation of evolutionary timescales between discovery of new folds and generation of new sequences gives rise to emergence of protein families and superfamilies whose sizes are power-law distributed, closely matching the same distributions for real proteins. On the population level we observe emergence of species--subpopulations that carry similar genomes. Further, we present a simple theory that relates stability of evolving proteins to the sizes of emerging genomes. Together, these results provide a microscopic first-principles picture of how first-gene families developed in the course of early evolution.},

abstract = {Increasingly exact measurement of single crystal X-ray diffraction data offers detailed characterization of DNA conformation, hydration and electrostatics. However, instead of providing a more clear and unambiguous image of DNA, highly accurate diffraction data reveal polymorphism of the DNA atomic positions and conformation and hydration. Here we describe an accurate X-ray structure of B-DNA, painstakingly fit to a multistate model that contains multiple competing positions of most of the backbone and of entire base pairs. Two of ten base-pairs of CCAGGCCTGG are in multiple states distinguished primarily by differences in slide. Similarly, all the surrounding ions are seen to fractionally occupy discrete competing and overlapping sites. And finally, the vast majority of water molecules show strong evidence of multiple competing sites. Conventional resolution appears to give a false sense of homogeneity in conformation and interactions of DNA. In addition, conventional resolution yields an average structure that is not accurate, in that it is different from any of the multiple discrete structures observed at high resolution. Because base pair positional heterogeneity has not always been incorporated into model-building, even some high and ultrahigh-resolution structures of DNA do not indicate the full extent of conformational polymorphism.},

abstract = {The folding and stability of RNA tertiary interactions depend critically on cationic conditions. It is usually difficult, however, to isolate such effects on tertiary interactions from those on the entire RNA. By manipulating conformations of single RNA molecules using optical tweezers, we distinguished individual steps of breaking and forming of a two-base-pair kissing interaction from those of secondary folding. The binding of metal ions to the small tertiary structure appeared to be saturable with an apparent Kd of 160 mM for K(+) and 1.5 mM for Mg(2+). The kissing formation was estimated to be associated with binding of ∼2-3 diffuse K(+) or Mg(2+) ions. At their saturated binding, Mg(2+) provided ∼3 kcal/mol more stabilizing energy to the structure than K(+). Furthermore, the cations change the unkissing forces significantly more than the kissing ones. For example, the presence of Mg(2+) ions increased the average unkissing force from 21 pN to 44 pN, surprisingly high for breaking merely two base pairs; in contrast, the mean kissing force was changed by only 4.5 pN. Interestingly, the differential salt effects on the transition forces were not caused by different changes in the height of the kinetic barriers but were instead attributed to how different molecular structures respond to the applied force. Our results showed the importance of diffuse cation binding to the stability of tertiary interaction and demonstrated the utility of mechanical unfolding in studying tertiary interactions.},

Rhythmic seasonal patterns of microbial community turnover are revealed when high-resolution measurements of microbial plankton diversity are applied to samples collected in lengthy time series. Seasonal cycles in microbial plankton are complex, but the expansion of fixed ocean stations monitoring long-term change and the development of automated instrumentation are providing the time-series data needed to understand how these cycles vary across broad geographical scales. By accumulating data and using predictive modeling, we gain insights into changes that will occur as the ocean surface continues to warm and as the extent and duration of ocean stratification increase. These developments will enable marine scientists to predict changes in geochemical cycles mediated by microbial communities and to gauge their broader impacts.},

abstract = {The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) generated considerable interest in developing short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for understanding basic biology and as the active agents in a new variety of therapeutics. Early studies showed that selecting an active siRNA was not as straightforward as simply picking a sequence on the target mRNA and synthesizing the siRNA complementary to that sequence. As interest in applying RNAi has increased, the methods for identifying active siRNA sequences have evolved from focusing on the simplicity of synthesis and purification, to identifying preferred target sequences and secondary structures, to predicting the thermodynamic stability of the siRNA. As more specific details of the RNAi mechanism have been defined, these have been incorporated into more complex siRNA selection algorithms, increasing the reliability of selecting active siRNAs against a single target. Ultimately, design of the best siRNA therapeutics will require design of the siRNA itself, in addition to design of the vehicle and other components necessary for it to function in vivo. In this minireview, we summarize the evolution of siRNA selection techniques with a particular focus on one issue of current importance to the field, how best to identify those siRNA sequences likely to have high activity. Approaches to designing active siRNAs through chemical and structural modifications will also be highlighted. As the understanding of how to control the activity and specificity of siRNAs improves, the potential utility of siRNAs as human therapeutics will concomitantly grow.},

@article{Schneider1991,
abstract = {Like macroscopic machines, molecular-sized machines are limited by their material components, their design, and their use of power. One of these limits is the maximum number of states that a machine can choose from. The logarithm to the base 2 of the number of states is defined to be the number of bits of information that the machine could "gain" during its operation. The maximum possible information gain is a function of the energy that a molecular machine dissipates into the surrounding medium (Py), the thermal noise energy which disturbs the machine (Ny) and the number of independently moving parts involved in the operation (dspace): Cy = dspace log2 Py + Ny)/Ny bits per operation. This "machine capacity" is closely related to Shannon's channel capacity for communications systems. An important theorem that Shannon proved for communication channels also applies to molecular machines. With regard to molecular machines, the theorem states that if the amount of information which a machine gains is less than or equal to Cy, then the error rate (frequency of failure) can be made arbitrarily small by using a sufficiently complex coding of the molecular machine's operation. Thus, the capacity of a molecular machine is sharply limited by the dissipation and the thermal noise, but the machine failure rate can be reduced to whatever low level may be required for the organism to survive.},

We determined 3 angstrom resolution x-ray crystal structures of EF-G complexed with a nonhydrolyzable guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) analog and bound to the Escherichia coli ribosome in different states of ribosomal subunit rotation. The structures reveal that EF-G binding to the ribosome stabilizes switch regions in the GTPase active site, resulting in a compact EF-G conformation that favors an intermediate state of ribosomal subunit rotation. These structures suggest that EF-G controls the translocation reaction by cycles of conformational rigidity and relaxation before and after GTP hydrolysis.},

abstract = {Multi- and pan-antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major health challenge in hospital settings. Furthermore, when susceptible bacteria establish surface-attached biofilm populations, they become recalcitrant to antimicrobial therapy. Therefore, there is a need for novel antimicrobials that are effective against multi-drug-resistant and surface-attached bacteria. A screen to identify prokaryote-derived antimicrobials from a panel of over 100 bacterial strains was performed. One compound isolated from Citrobacter freundii exhibited antimicrobial activity against a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria and was effective against biofilms. Random transposon mutagenesis was performed to find mutants unable to produce the antimicrobial compound. Transposons mapped to a bacteriocin gene located on a small plasmid capable of replication in Escherichia coli. The plasmid was sequenced and found to be highly similar to a previously described colicinogenic plasmid. Expression of the predicted bacteriocin immunity gene conferred bacteriocin immunity to E. coli. The predicted bacteriocin gene, colA-43864, expressed in E. coli was sufficient to generate anti-microbial activity, and purified recombinant ColA-43864 was highly effective in killing E. coli, Citrobacter species, and Klebsiella pneumoniae cells in a planktonic and biofilm state. This study suggests that bacteriocins can be an effective way to control surface-attached pathogenic bacteria.},

We describe the design and directed assembly of tecto-RNA units ranging from closed, cooperatively assembling ring-shaped complexes of programmable stoichiometries (dimers, trimers and tetramers) to open multimeric structures. The novelty of this work is that tuning of the stoichiometries of self-assembled complexes is achieved by precise positioning of the interaction motifs in the monomer units rather than changing their binding specificities. Structure-probing and transmission electron microscopy studies as well as thermodynamic analysis support formation of closed cooperative complexes that are highly resistant to nuclease digestion. The present designs provide two helical arms per RNA monomer for further functionalization aims.},

abstract = {A vital constituent of a virus is its protein shell, called the viral capsid, that encapsulates and hence provides protection for the viral genome. Assembly models are developed for viral capsids built from protein building blocks that can assume different local bonding structures in the capsid. This situation occurs, for example, for viruses in the family of Papovaviridae, which are linked to cancer and are hence of particular interest for the health sector. More specifically, the viral capsids of the (pseudo-) T = 7 particles in this family consist of pentamers that exhibit two different types of bonding structures. While this scenario cannot be described mathematically in terms of Caspar-Klug theory (Caspar D L D and Klug A 1962 Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 27 1), it can be modelled via tiling theory (Twarock R 2004 J. Theor. Biol. 226 477). The latter is used to encode the local bonding environment of the building blocks in a combinatorial structure, called the assembly tree, which is a basic ingredient in the derivation of assembly models for Papovaviridae along the lines of the equilibrium approach of Zlotnick (Zlotnick A 1994 J. Mol. Biol. 241 59). A phase space formalism is introduced to characterize the changes in the assembly pathways and intermediates triggered by the variations in the association energies characterizing the bonds between the building blocks in the capsid. Furthermore, the assembly pathways and concentrations of the statistically dominant assembly intermediates are determined. The example of Simian virus 40 is discussed in detail.},

abstract = {Understanding the numerous functions that RNAs play in living cells depends critically on knowledge of their three-dimensional structure. Due to the difficulties in experimentally assessing structures of large RNAs, there is currently great demand for new high-resolution structure prediction methods. We present the novel method for the fully automated prediction of RNA 3D structures from a user-defined secondary structure. The concept is founded on the machine translation system. The translation engine operates on the RNA FRABASE database tailored to the dictionary relating the RNA secondary structure and tertiary structure elements. The translation algorithm is very fast. Initial 3D structure is composed in a range of seconds on a single processor. The method assures the prediction of large RNA 3D structures of high quality. Our approach needs neither structural templates nor RNA sequence alignment, required for comparative methods. This enables the building of unresolved yet native and artificial RNA structures. The method is implemented in a publicly available, user-friendly server RNAComposer. It works in an interactive mode and a batch mode. The batch mode is designed for large-scale modelling and accepts atomic distance restraints. Presently, the server is set to build RNA structures of up to 500 residues.},

abstract = {The Antarctic continent harbors a range of specialized and sometimes highly localized microbial biotopes. These include biotopes associated with desiccated mineral soils, rich ornithogenic soils, glacial and sea ice, ice-covered lakes, translucent rocks, and geothermally heated soils. All are characterized by the imposition of one or more environmental extremes (including low temperature, wide temperature fluctuations, desiccation, hypersalinity, high periodic radiation fluxes, and low nutrient status). As our understanding of the true microbial diversity in these biotopes expands from the application of molecular phylogenetic methods, we come closer to the point where we can make an accurate assessment of the impacts of environmental change, human intervention, and other natural and unnatural impositions. At present, it is possible to make reasonable predictions about the physical effects of local climate change, but only general predictions on possible changes in microbial community structure. The consequences of some direct human impacts, such as physical disruption of microbial soil communities, are obvious if not yet quantitated. Others, such as the dissemination of nonindigenous microorganisms into indigenous microbial communities, are not yet understood.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions play crucial roles in the execution of various biological functions. Accordingly, their comprehensive description would contribute considerably to the functional interpretation of fully sequenced genomes, which are flooded with novel genes of unpredictable functions. We previously developed a system to examine two-hybrid interactions in all possible combinations between the approximately 6,000 proteins of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we have completed the comprehensive analysis using this system to identify 4,549 two-hybrid interactions among 3,278 proteins. Unexpectedly, these data do not largely overlap with those obtained by the other project [Uetz, P., et al. (2000) Nature (London) 403, 623-627] and hence have substantially expanded our knowledge on the protein interaction space or interactome of the yeast. Cumulative connection of these binary interactions generates a single huge network linking the vast majority of the proteins. Bioinformatics-aided selection of biologically relevant interactions highlights various intriguing subnetworks. They include, for instance, the one that had successfully foreseen the involvement of a novel protein in spindle pole body function as well as the one that may uncover a hitherto unidentified multiprotein complex potentially participating in the process of vesicular transport. Our data would thus significantly expand and improve the protein interaction map for the exploration of genome functions that eventually leads to thorough understanding of the cell as a molecular system.},

Salinibacter ruber is among these organisms and has been found repeatedly in significant numbers in climax saltern crystallizer communities. The phenotype of this bacterium is remarkably similar to that of the hyperhalophilic Archaea (Haloarchaea). The genome sequence suggests that this resemblance has arisen through convergence at the physiological level (different genes producing similar overall phenotype) and the molecular level (independent mutations yielding similar sequences or structures). Several genes and gene clusters also derive by lateral transfer from (or may have been laterally transferred to) haloarchaea. S. ruber encodes four rhodopsins. One resembles bacterial proteorhodopsins and three are of the haloarchaeal type, previously uncharacterized in a bacterial genome. The impact of these modular adaptive elements on the cell biology and ecology of S. ruber is substantial, affecting salt adaptation, bioenergetics, and photobiology.},

abstract = {We describe a method that detects proteins capable of interacting with a known protein and that results in the immediate availability of the cloned genes for these interacting proteins. Plasmids are constructed to encode two hybrid proteins. One hybrid consists of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional activator protein GAL4 fused to the known protein; the other hybrid consists of the GAL4 activation domain fused to protein sequences encoded by a library of yeast genomic DNA fragments. Interaction between the known protein and a protein encoded by one of the library plasmids leads to transcriptional activation of a reporter gene containing a binding site for GAL4. We used this method with the yeast SIR4 protein, which is involved in the transcriptional repression of yeast mating type information. (i) We used the two-hybrid system to demonstrate that SIR4 can form homodimers. (ii) A small domain consisting of the C terminus of SIR4 was shown to be sufficient to mediate this interaction. (iii) We screened a library to detect hybrid proteins that could interact with the SIR4 C-terminal domain and identified SIR4 from this library. This approach could be readily extended to mammalian proteins by the construction of appropriate cDNA libraries in the activation domain plasmid.},

abstract = {An understanding of the functional organization of nucleoli, the sites of ribosome biosynthesis, is limited by the present uncertainty about the topological arrangement of the transcribing rRNA genes. Since studies with "standard" nucleoli from somatic cells produced conflicting results, we have examined the amplified nucleoli of Xenopus oocytes. These nucleoli are unique in that they contain high copy numbers of rRNA genes, are not attached to chromosomes, lack non-ribosomal DNA and can be examined in light microscopic spread preparations of nuclear contents. By immunostaining and confocal microscopy we show that in growing stage IV oocytes the sites of rDNA are surrounded by the dense fibrillar component. The rDNA is actively transcribed as revealed by BrUTP injection into oocytes and localization of components of the nucleolar transcription machinery (RNA polymerase I and the transcription factor UBF). At the ultrastructural level, the rDNA sites correlate with the fibrillar centers of amplified nucleoli fixed in situ. The results provide clear evidence that the transcriptionally active rRNA genes are confined to the fibrillar centers of the oocyte nucleoli and open the possibility to analyze the protein composition of almost native, transcriptionally highly active nucleolar chromatin by immunofluorescence microscopy.},

abstract = {Using the atomic structures of the large ribosomal subunit from Haloarcula marismortui and its complexes with two substrate analogs, we establish that the ribosome is a ribozyme and address the catalytic properties of its all-RNA active site. Both substrate analogs are contacted exclusively by conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) residues from domain V of 23S rRNA; there are no protein side-chain atoms closer than about 18 angstroms to the peptide bond being synthesized. The mechanism of peptide bond synthesis appears to re- semble the reverse of the acylation step in serine proteases, with the base of A2486 (A2451 in Escherichia coli) playing the same general base role as his- tidine-57 in chymotrypsin. The unusual pKa (where Ka is the acid dissociation constant) required for A2486 to perform this function may derive in part from its hydrogen bonding to G2482 (G2447 in E. coli), which also interacts with a buried phosphate that could stabilize unusual tautomers of these two bases. The polypeptide exit tunnel is largely formed by RNA but has significant contri- butions from proteins L4, L22, and L39e, and its exit is encircled by proteins L19, L22, L23, L24, L29, and L31e},

abstract = {Evolutionarily conserved RNA secondary structures are a robust indicator of purifying selection and, consequently, molecular function. Evaluating their genome-wide occurrence through comparative genomics has consistently been plagued by high false-positive rates and divergent predictions. We present a novel benchmarking pipeline aimed at calibrating the precision of genome-wide scans for consensus RNA structure prediction. The benchmarking data obtained from two refined structure prediction algorithms, RNAz and SISSIz, were then analyzed to fine-tune the parameters of an optimized workflow for genomic sliding window screens. When applied to consistency-based multiple genome alignments of 35 mammals, our approach confidently identifies >4 million evolutionarily constrained RNA structures using a conservative sensitivity threshold that entails historically low false discovery rates for such analyses (5-22\%). These predictions comprise 13.6\% of the human genome, 88\% of which fall outside any known sequence-constrained element, suggesting that a large proportion of the mammalian genome is functional. As an example, our findings identify both known and novel conserved RNA structure motifs in the long noncoding RNA MALAT1. This study provides an extensive set of functional transcriptomic annotations that will assist researchers in uncovering the precise mechanisms underlying the developmental ontologies of higher eukaryotes.},

In this review, we highlight the insights about the extent of diversity that may be gained by considering patterns that occur, or are likely to occur, in the relative abundance of prokaryotic taxa. We posit that global reservoirs of diversity are an important driving force behind patterns in localised diversity seen in leaves, intestines and wastewater treatment reactors. Thus, where the reservoir community is very large and relatively even, chance alone will prevent physically identical communities from having the same, or sometimes even stable, communities. By contrast, communities that tend to be similar (even when not physically identical) and stable are observed where the source diversity is low. Thus the relationship between structure and function in a community can only be understood, predicted and engineered through an understanding of the source of diversity from which the community is drawn.},

Understanding the architecture and function of active RNA molecules requires methods for comparing and analyzing their 3D structures.

Here, we present the SETTER web server for the RNA structure pairwise comparison utilizing the SETTER (SEcondary sTructure-based TERtiary Structure Similarity Algorithm) algorithm. The SETTER method divides an RNA structure into the set of non-overlapping structural elements called generalized secondary structure units (GSSUs). The SETTER algorithm scales as O(n(2)) with the size of a GSSUs and as O(n) with the number of GSSUs in the structure. This scaling gives SETTER its high speed as the average size of the GSSU remains constant irrespective of the size of the structure. However, the favorable speed of the algorithm does not compromise its accuracy. The SETTER web server together with the stand-alone implementation of the SETTER algorithm are freely accessible at http://siret.cz/setter.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used for biological sequence analysis because of their ability to incorporate biological information in their structure. An automatic means of optimizing the structure of HMMs would be highly desirable. However, this raises two important issues; first, the new HMMs should be biologically interpretable, and second, we need to control the complexity of the HMM so that it has good generalization performance on unseen sequences. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using a genetic algorithm (GA) for optimizing the HMM structure. GAs are sufficiently flexible to allow incorporation of other techniques such as Baum-Welch training within their evolutionary cycle. Furthermore, operators that alter the structure of HMMs can be designed to favour interpretable and simple structures. In this paper, a training strategy using GAs is proposed, and it is tested on finding HMM structures for the promoter and coding region of the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni. The proposed GA for hidden Markov models (GA-HMM) allows, HMMs with different numbers of states to evolve. To prevent over-fitting, a separate dataset is used for comparing the performance of the HMMs to that used for the Baum-Welch training. The GA-HMM was capable of finding an HMM comparable to a hand-coded HMM designed for the same task, which has been published previously.},

Cognate transfer RNA (tRNA) binding induces global domain movements of the 30S subunit and changes in the conformation of the universally conserved and essential bases A1492, A1493, and G530 of 16S RNA. These bases interact intimately with the minor groove of the first two base pairs between the codon and anticodon, thus sensing Watson-Crick base-pairing geometry and discriminating against near-cognate tRNA. The third, or "wobble," position of the codon is free to accommodate certain noncanonical base pairs. By partially inducing these structural changes, paromomycin facilitates binding of near-cognate tRNAs.},

These elements function as building blocks in the design of diverse RNA molecules with various fundamental functions in the cell. To better understand the intricate architecture of three-dimensional (3D) RNAs, we analyze existing RNA four-way junctions in terms of base-pair interactions and 3D configurations. Specifically, we identify nine broad junction families according to coaxial stacking patterns and helical configurations. We find that helices within junctions tend to arrange in roughly parallel and perpendicular patterns and stabilize their conformations using common tertiary motifs such as coaxial stacking, loop-helix interaction, and helix packing interaction. Our analysis also reveals a number of highly conserved base-pair interaction patterns and novel tertiary motifs such as A-minor-coaxial stacking combinations and sarcin/ricin motif variants. Such analyses of RNA building blocks can ultimately help in the difficult task of RNA 3D structure prediction.},

abstract = {The secondary structure of encapsidated MS2 genomic RNA poses an interesting RNA folding challenge. Cryoelectron microscopy has demonstrated that encapsidated MS2 RNA is well-ordered. Models of MS2 assembly suggest that the RNA hairpin-protein interactions and the appropriate placement of hairpins in the MS2 RNA secondary structure can guide the formation of the correct icosahedral particle. The RNA hairpin motif that is recognized by the MS2 capsid protein dimers, however, is energetically unfavorable, and thus free energy predictions are biased against this motif. Computer programs called Crumple, Sliding Windows, and Assembly provide useful tools for prediction of viral RNA secondary structures when the traditional assumptions of RNA structure prediction by free energy minimization may not apply. These methods allow incorporation of global features of the RNA fold and motifs that are difficult to include directly in minimum free energy predictions. For example, with MS2 RNA the experimental data from SELEX experiments, crystallography, and theoretical calculations of the path for the series of hairpins can be incorporated in the RNA structure prediction, and thus the influence of free energy considerations can be modulated. This approach thoroughly explores conformational space and generates an ensemble of secondary structures. The predictions from this new approach can test hypotheses and models of viral assembly and guide construction of complete three-dimensional models of virus particles.},

abstract = {Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli O157:H7 are major food-borne pathogens causing serious illness. Phage SFP10, which revealed effective infection of both S. enterica and E. coli O157:H7, was isolated and characterized. SFP10 contains a 158-kb double-stranded DNA genome belonging to the Vi01 phage-like family Myoviridae. In vitro adsorption assays showed that the adsorption constant rates to both Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 were 2.50 × 10⁻⁸ ml/min and 1.91 × 10⁻⁸ ml/min, respectively. One-step growth analysis revealed that SFP10 has a shorter latent period (25 min) and a larger burst size (>200 PFU) than ordinary Myoviridae phages, suggesting effective host infection and lytic activity. However, differential development of resistance to SFP10 in S. Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 was observed; bacteriophage-insensitive mutant (BIM) frequencies of 1.19 × 10⁻² CFU/ml for S. Typhimurium and 4.58 × 10⁻⁵ CFU/ml for E. coli O157:H7 were found, indicating that SFP10 should be active and stable for control of E. coli O157:H7 with minimal emergence of SFP10-resistant pathogens but may not be for S. Typhimurium. Specific mutation of rfaL in S. Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 revealed the O antigen as an SFP10 receptor for both bacteria. Genome sequence analysis of SFP10 and its comparative analysis with homologous Salmonella Vi01 and Shigella phiSboM-AG3 phages revealed that their tail fiber and tail spike genes share low sequence identity, implying that the genes are major host specificity determinants. This is the first report identifying specific infection and inhibition of Salmonella Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 by a single bacteriophage.},

abstract = {Three anaerobic, moderately thermophilic, syntrophic primary alcohol- and lactate-degrading microbes, designated strains JL(T), JE and OL, were isolated from sludges of thermophilic (55 degrees C) digesters that decomposed either municipal solid wastes or sewage sludge. The strains were strictly anaerobic organisms. All three strains grew at 25-60 degrees C and pH 5.5-8.5 and optimum growth was observed at 45-50 degrees C and pH 6.0-7.0. The three organisms grew chemo-organotrophically on a number of carbohydrates in the presence of yeast extract. In co-culture with the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus, all strains could utilize ethanol, glycerol and lactate syntrophically for growth, although these compounds were not metabolized in pure culture without additional external electron acceptors. All strains could reduce thiosulphate. Quinones were not detected. The DNA G+C contents of strains JL(T), JE and OL were 38.0, 37.3 and 37.7 mol\%, respectively. Major cellular fatty acids of the strains were iso-C(15 : 0), C(16 : 0) and unsaturated species of C(15 : 1). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the strains belong to a deeply branched lineage of the phylum Firmicutes; the most closely related species was Thermovenabulum ferriorganovorum (16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 88 \%). The three strains were phylogenetically very closely related to each other (99-100 \% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and were physiologically and chemotaxonomically similar. These genetic and phenotypic properties suggest that the strains should be classified as representatives of a novel species and genus; the name Tepidanaerobacter syntrophicus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Tepidanaerobacter syntrophicus is strain JL(T) (=JCM 12098(T)=NBRC 100060(T)=DSM 15584(T)).},

abstract = {Estimates of the total number of bacterial species indicate that existing DNA sequence databases carry only a tiny fraction of the total amount of DNA sequence space represented by this division of life. Indeed, environmental DNA samples have been shown to encode many previously unknown classes of proteins and RNAs. Bioinformatics searches of genomic DNA from bacteria commonly identify new noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as riboswitches. In rare instances, RNAs that exhibit more extensive sequence and structural conservation across a wide range of bacteria are encountered. Given that large structured RNAs are known to carry out complex biochemical functions such as protein synthesis and RNA processing reactions, identifying more RNAs of great size and intricate structure is likely to reveal additional biochemical functions that can be achieved by RNA. We applied an updated computational pipeline to discover ncRNAs that rival the known large ribozymes in size and structural complexity or that are among the most abundant RNAs in bacteria that encode them. These RNAs would have been difficult or impossible to detect without examining environmental DNA sequences, indicating that numerous RNAs with extraordinary size, structural complexity, or other exceptional characteristics remain to be discovered in unexplored sequence space.},

abstract = {The expression of stable RNA (rRNA and tRNA) genes and the concentration of guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) were measured in an isogenic pair of relA+ and relA derivatives of Escherichia coli B/r. The cells were either growing exponentially at different rates or subject to amino acid starvation when they were measured. The specific stable RNA gene activity (rs/rt, the rate of rRNA and tRNA synthesis relative to the total instantaneous rate of RNA synthesis) was found to decrease from 1.0 at a ppGpp concentration of 0 (extrapolated value) to 0.24 at saturating concentrations of ppGpp (above 100 pmoles per optical density at 460 nm unit of cell mass). The same relationship between the rs/rt ratio and ppGpp concentration was obtained independent of the physiological state of the bacteria (i.e., independent of the growth rate or of amino acid starvation) and independent of the relA allele. It can be concluded that ppGpp is an effector for stable RNA gene control and that stable RNA genes are not controlled by factors other than the ppGpp-mediated system. The results were shown to be qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with data on in vitro rRNA gene control by ppGpp, and they were interpreted in the light of reported ideas derived from those in vitro experiments.},

abstract = {Protein biosynthesis on the ribosome requires repeated cycles of ratcheting, which couples rotation of the two ribosomal subunits with respect to each other, and swiveling of the head domain of the small subunit. However, the molecular basis for how the two ribosomal subunits rearrange contacts with each other during ratcheting while remaining stably associated is not known. Here, we describe x-ray crystal structures of the intact Escherichia coli ribosome, either in the apo-form (3.5 angstrom resolution) or with one (4.0 angstrom resolution) or two (4.0 angstrom resolution) anticodon stem-loop tRNA mimics bound, that reveal intermediate states of intersubunit rotation. In the structures, the interface between the small and large ribosomal subunits rearranges in discrete steps along the ratcheting pathway. Positioning of the head domain of the small subunit is controlled by interactions with the large subunit and with the tRNA bound in the peptidyl-tRNA site. The intermediates observed here provide insight into how tRNAs move into the hybrid state of binding that precedes the final steps of mRNA and tRNA translocation.},

abstract = {Biotrophic eukaryotic plant pathogens require a living host for their growth and form an intimate haustorial interface with parasitized cells. Evolution to biotrophy occurred independently in fungal rusts and powdery mildews, and in oomycete white rusts and downy mildews. Biotroph evolution and molecular mechanisms of biotrophy are poorly understood. It has been proposed, but not shown, that obligate biotrophy results from (i) reduced selection for maintenance of biosynthetic pathways and (ii) gain of mechanisms to evade host recognition or suppress host defence. Here we use Illumina sequencing to define the genome, transcriptome, and gene models for the obligate biotroph oomycete and Arabidopsis parasite, Albugo laibachii. A. laibachii is a member of the Chromalveolata, which incorporates Heterokonts (containing the oomycetes), Apicomplexa (which includes human parasites like Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii), and four other taxa. From comparisons with other oomycete plant pathogens and other chromalveolates, we reveal independent loss of molybdenum-cofactor-requiring enzymes in downy mildews, white rusts, and the malaria parasite P. falciparum. Biotrophy also requires "effectors" to suppress host defence; we reveal RXLR and Crinkler effectors shared with other oomycetes, and also discover and verify a novel class of effectors, the "CHXCs", by showing effector delivery and effector functionality. Our findings suggest that evolution to progressively more intimate association between host and parasite results in reduced selection for retention of certain biosynthetic pathways, and particularly reduced selection for retention of molybdopterin-requiring biosynthetic pathways. These mechanisms are not only relevant to plant pathogenic oomycetes but also to human pathogens within the Chromalveolata.},

Moreover, the last decade has seen a boom in the number of variant index structures featuring complex and diverse memory-time trade-offs. This article brings a comprehensive state-of-the-art overview of the most popular index structures and their recently developed variants. Their features, interrelationships, the trade-offs they impose, but also their practical limitations, are explained and compared.},

abstract = {Vast expanses of oxygen-deficient and nitrite-rich water define the major oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) of the global ocean. They support diverse microbial communities that influence the nitrogen economy of the oceans, contributing to major losses of fixed nitrogen as dinitrogen (N(2)) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) gases. Anaerobic microbial processes, including the two pathways of N(2) production, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation, are oxygen-sensitive, with some occurring only under strictly anoxic conditions. The detection limit of the usual method (Winkler titrations) for measuring dissolved oxygen in seawater, however, is much too high to distinguish low oxygen conditions from true anoxia. However, new analytical technologies are revealing vanishingly low oxygen concentrations in nitrite-rich OMZs, indicating that these OMZs are essentially anoxic marine zones (AMZs). Autonomous monitoring platforms also reveal previously unrecognized episodic intrusions of oxygen into the AMZ core, which could periodically support aerobic metabolisms in a typically anoxic environment. Although nitrogen cycling is considered to dominate the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of AMZs, recent environmental genomics and geochemical studies show the presence of other relevant processes, particularly those associated with the sulfur and carbon cycles. AMZs correspond to an intermediate state between two "end points" represented by fully oxic systems and fully sulfidic systems. Modern and ancient AMZs and sulfidic basins are chemically and functionally related. Global change is affecting the magnitude of biogeochemical fluxes and ocean chemical inventories, leading to shifts in AMZ chemistry and biology that are likely to continue well into the future.},

All strains fermented cellobiose, D-fructose, D-galactose, D-glucose, lactose, maltose, D-mannitol, D-mannose, melibiose, D-ribose, salicin, D-sorbitol, sucrose and trehalose. Some strains fermented L-(-)-arabinose and L-rhamnose. D-Xylose was not fermented and starch was not hydrolysed. The mean G+C content of the DNA was 48 mol\%. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rDNA established that the isolates were members of the genus Lactobacillus. DNA reassociation of 45\% or less was obtained between the new isolates and the reference strains of species with G+C contents of about 48 mol\%. The isolates were differentiated from other homofermentative Lactobacillus spp. on the basis of 16S rDNA sequence divergence, DNA relatedness, stereoisomerism of the lactic acid produced, growth temperature and carbohydrate fermentation. The data support the conclusion that these organisms represent strains of a new species, for which the name Lactobacillus arizonensis is proposed. The type strain of L. arizonensis is NRRL B-14768T (= DSM 13273T).},

abstract = {Ribotoxins are potent inhibitors of protein biosynthesis and inactivate ribosomes from a variety of organisms. The ribotoxin alpha-sarcin cleaves the large 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) at the universally conserved sarcin-ricin loop (SRL) leading to complete inactivation of the ribosome and cellular death. The SRL interacts with translation factors that hydrolyze GTP, and it is important for their binding to the ribosome, but its precise role is not yet understood. We studied the effect of alpha-sarcin on defined steps of translation by the bacterial ribosome. alpha-Sarcin-treated ribosomes showed no defects in mRNA and tRNA binding, peptide-bond formation and sparsomycin-dependent translocation. Cleavage of SRL slightly affected binding of elongation factor Tu ternary complex (EF-Tu*GTP*tRNA) to the ribosome. In contrast, the activity of elongation factor G (EF-G) was strongly impaired in alpha-sarcin-treated ribosomes. Importantly, cleavage of SRL inhibited EF-G binding, and consequently GTP hydrolysis and mRNA-tRNA translocation. These results suggest that the SRL is more critical in EF-G than ternary complex binding to the ribosome implicating different requirements in this region of the ribosome during protein elongation.},

@article{Alimenti2009,
abstract = {Unique opportunities are provided by phylogenetically closely related organisms thriving in stably cold, or temperate milieus to study adaptive modifications of structurally homologous molecules. These modifications are of keen interest in basic science as well as in biotechnology. This review highlights structural and functional specificities that differentiate two homologous families of psychrophilic and mesophilic water-borne proteins (designated as pheromones) that signal mitotic growth and sexual mating in two marine species of the protozoan ciliate Euplotes, i.e., E. nobilii, which is distributed in Antarctic and Arctic waters, and E. raikovi, which inhabits temperate waters. The two protein families show strict conservation of a common three-helix bundle in a compact core of the molecular structure, which provides long-lasting integrity and biological activity to these molecules in their natural environment. In the psychrophilic pheromone family, cold-adaptation appears to have been achieved by superimposing an integrated complex of structural modifications on this conserved scaffold. Functionally most relevant appear to be extensions of polypeptide segments devoid of regular secondary structures, a specific distribution of polar and hydrophobic amino acids, the presence of solvent-exposed clusters of negatively charged amino acid side chains, and a unique role of aromatic residues in anchoring the molecular architecture. Due to these modifications, the psychrophilic pheromones are an example of an elegant combination of high stability of the three-dimensional structures with sufficient structural plasticity for efficient functioning at their physiologically low temperatures.},

abstract = {There is mounting evidence indicating that protein synthesis is driven and regulated by mechanisms that direct stochastic, large-scale conformational fluctuations of the translational apparatus. This mechanistic paradigm implies that a free-energy landscape governs the conformational states that are accessible to and sampled by the translating ribosome. This scenario presents interdependent opportunities and challenges for structural and dynamic studies of protein synthesis. Indeed, the synergism between cryogenic electron microscopic and X-ray crystallographic structural studies, on the one hand, and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) dynamic studies, on the other, is emerging as a powerful means for investigating the complex free-energy landscape of the translating ribosome and uncovering the mechanisms that direct the stochastic conformational fluctuations of the translational machinery. In this review, we highlight the principal insights obtained from cryogenic electron microscopic, X-ray crystallographic, and smFRET studies of the elongation stage of protein synthesis and outline the emerging themes, questions, and challenges that lie ahead in mechanistic studies of translation.},

@article{Zhang2006,
abstract = {The process by which hundreds of identical capsid proteins self-assemble into icosahedral structures is complex and poorly understood. Establishing constraints on the assembly pathways is crucial to building reliable theoretical models. For example, it is currently an open question to what degree overall assembly kinetics are dominated by one or a few most efficient pathways versus the enormous number theoretically possible. The importance of this question, however, is often overlooked due to the difficulties of addressing it in either theoretical or experimental practice. We apply a computer model based on a discrete-event simulation method to evaluate the contributions of nondominant pathways to overall assembly kinetics. This is accomplished by comparing two possible assembly models: one allowing growth to proceed only by the accretion of individual assembly subunits and the other allowing the binding of sterically compatible assembly intermediates any sizes. Simulations show that the two models perform almost identically under low binding rate conditions, where growth is strongly nucleation-limited, but sharply diverge under conditions of higher association rates or coat protein concentrations. The results suggest the importance of identifying the actual binding pattern if one is to build reliable models of capsid assembly or other complex self-assembly processes.},

The isolate showed Gram- and catalase-positive reactions and formed a terminal endospore with a swollen sporangium. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15:0), iso-C(15:0), anteiso-C(17:0) and iso-C(16:0). The genomic DNA G+C content of the strain was 41.0 mol\%.

abstract = {Bacteria and archaea possess adaptive immune systems that rely on small RNAs for defense against invasive genetic elements. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) genomic loci are transcribed as long precursor RNAs, which must be enzymatically cleaved to generate mature CRISPR-derived RNAs (crRNAs) that serve as guides for foreign nucleic acid targeting and degradation. This processing occurs within the repetitive sequence and is catalyzed by a dedicated Cas6 family member in many CRISPR systems. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, crRNA biogenesis requires the endoribonuclease Csy4 (Cas6f), which binds and cleaves at the 3' side of a stable RNA stem-loop structure encoded by the CRISPR repeat. We show here that Csy4 recognizes its RNA substrate with an ∼50 pM equilibrium dissociation constant, making it one of the highest-affinity protein:RNA interactions of this size reported to date. Tight binding is mediated exclusively by interactions upstream of the scissile phosphate that allow Csy4 to remain bound to its product and thereby sequester the crRNA for downstream targeting. Substrate specificity is achieved by RNA major groove contacts that are highly sensitive to helical geometry, as well as a strict preference for guanosine adjacent to the scissile phosphate in the active site. Collectively, our data highlight diverse modes of substrate recognition employed by Csy4 to enable accurate selection of CRISPR transcripts while avoiding spurious, off-target RNA binding and cleavage.},

Inhibiting the pathologic folding and oligomerization of Abeta could be effective in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Here, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent, we probe the initial stages of folding of a decapeptide segment of Abeta, Abeta(21-30), shown experimentally to nucleate the folding process. In addition, we examine the folding of a homologous decapeptide containing an amino acid substitution linked to hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type, [Gln-22]Abeta(21-30). We find that: (i) when the decapeptide is in water, hydrophobic interactions and transient salt bridges between Lys-28 and either Glu-22 or Asp-23 are important in the formation of a loop in the Val-24-Lys-28 region of the wild-type decapeptide; (ii) in the presence of salt ions, salt bridges play a more prominent role in the stabilization of the loop; (iii) in water with a reduced density, the decapeptide forms a helix, indicating the sensitivity of folding to different aqueous environments; and (iv) the "Dutch" peptide in water, in contrast to the wild-type peptide, fails to form a long-lived Val-24-Lys-28 loop, suggesting that loop stability is a critical factor in determining whether Abeta folds into pathologic structures.},

abstract = {The carboxysome is a bacterial microcompartment that functions as a simple organelle by sequestering enzymes involved in carbon fixation. The carboxysome shell is roughly 800 to 1400 angstroms in diameter and is assembled from several thousand protein subunits. Previous studies have revealed the three-dimensional structures of hexameric carboxysome shell proteins, which self-assemble into molecular layers that most likely constitute the facets of the polyhedral shell. Here, we report the three-dimensional structures of two proteins of previously unknown function, CcmL and OrfA (or CsoS4A), from the two known classes of carboxysomes, at resolutions of 2.4 and 2.15 angstroms. Both proteins assemble to form pentameric structures whose size and shape are compatible with formation of vertices in an icosahedral shell. Combining these pentamers with the hexamers previously elucidated gives two plausible, preliminary atomic models for the carboxysome shell.},

abstract = {During a survey of the culturable soil fungal population in samples collected in Taylor Valley, South Victoria Land, Antarctica, 13 basidiomycetous yeast strains with orange-coloured colonies were isolated. Phylogenetic analyses of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and partial LSU rRNA gene sequences showed that the strains belong to the Dioszegia clade of the Tremellales (Tremellomycetes, Agaricomycotina), but did not correspond to any of the hitherto recognized species. Two novel species, Dioszegia antarctica sp. nov. (type strain ANT-03-116(T) =CBS 10920(T) =PYCC 5970(T)) and Dioszegia cryoxerica sp. nov. (type strain ANT-03-071(T) =CBS 10919(T) =PYCC 5967(T)), are described to accommodate ten and three of these strains, respectively. Analysis of ITS sequences demonstrated intrastrain sequence heterogeneity in D. cryoxerica. The latter species is also notable for producing true hyphae with clamp connections and haustoria. However, no sexual structures were observed. The two novel species can be considered obligate psychrophiles, since they failed to grow above 20 degrees C and grew best between 10 and 15 degrees C.},

Nevertheless, software development in an academic setting is often unsystematic, which can lead to problems associated with maintenance and long-term availibility. Unfortunately, well-documented software development methodology is difficult to adopt, and technical measures that directly improve bioinformatic programming have not been described comprehensively. We have examined 22 software projects and have identified a set of practices for software development in an academic environment. We found them useful to plan a project, support the involvement of experts (e.g. experimentalists), and to promote higher quality and maintainability of the resulting programs. This article describes 12 techniques that facilitate a quick start into software engineering. We describe 3 of the 22 projects in detail and give many examples to illustrate the usage of particular techniques. We expect this toolbox to be useful for many bioinformatics programming projects and to the training of scientific programmers.},

@article{Tang2012,
abstract = {Molecular tools have revolutionized the exploration of biodiversity, especially in organisms for which traditional taxonomy is difficult, such as for microscopic animals (meiofauna). Environmental (eDNA) metabarcode surveys of DNA extracted from sediment samples are increasingly popular for surveying biodiversity. Most eDNA surveys use the nuclear gene-encoding small-subunit rDNA gene (18S) as a marker; however, different markers and metrics used for delimiting species have not yet been evaluated against each other or against morphologically defined species (morphospecies). We assessed more than 12,000 meiofaunal sequences of 18S and of the main alternatively used marker [Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) mtDNA] belonging to 55 datasets covering three taxonomic ranks. Our results show that 18S reduced diversity estimates by a factor of 0.4 relative to morphospecies, whereas COI increased diversity estimates by a factor of 7.6. Moreover, estimates of species richness using COI were robust among three of four commonly used delimitation metrics, whereas estimates using 18S varied widely with the different metrics. We show that meiofaunal diversity has been greatly underestimated by 18S eDNA surveys and that the use of COI provides a better estimate of diversity. The suitability of COI is supported by cross-mating experiments in the literature and evolutionary analyses of discreteness in patterns of genetic variation. Furthermore its splitting of morphospecies is expected from documented levels of cryptic taxa in exemplar meiofauna. We recommend against using 18S as a marker for biodiversity surveys and suggest that use of COI for eDNA surveys could provide more accurate estimates of species richness in the future.},

abstract = {Subtelomeric regions are often under-represented in genome sequences of eukaryotes. One of the best known examples of the use of telomere proximity for adaptive purposes are the bloodstream expression sites (BESs) of the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei. To enhance our understanding of BES structure and function in host adaptation and immune evasion, the BES repertoire from the Lister 427 strain of T. brucei were independently tagged and sequenced. BESs are polymorphic in size and structure but reveal a surprisingly conserved architecture in the context of extensive recombination. Very small BESs do exist and many functioning BESs do not contain the full complement of expression site associated genes (ESAGs). The consequences of duplicated or missing ESAGs, including ESAG9, a newly named ESAG12, and additional variant surface glycoprotein genes (VSGs) were evaluated by functional assays after BESs were tagged with a drug-resistance gene. Phylogenetic analysis of constituent ESAG families suggests that BESs are sequence mosaics and that extensive recombination has shaped the evolution of the BES repertoire. This work opens important perspectives in understanding the molecular mechanisms of antigenic variation, a widely used strategy for immune evasion in pathogens, and telomere biology.},

@article{Ivica2013,
abstract = {The hypothesized dual roles of RNA as both information carrier and biocatalyst during the earliest stages of life require a combination of features: good templating ability (for replication) and stable folding (for ribozymes). However, this poses the following paradox: well-folded sequences are poor templates for copying, but poorly folded sequences are unlikely to be good ribozymes. Here, we describe a strategy to overcome this dilemma through G:U wobble pairing in RNA. Unlike Watson-Crick base pairs, wobble pairs contribute highly to the energetic stability of the folded structure of their sequence, but only slightly, if at all, to the stability of the folded reverse complement. Sequences in the RNA World might thereby combine stable folding of the ribozyme with an unstructured, reverse-complementary genome, resulting in a "division of labor" between the strands. We demonstrate this strategy using computational simulations of RNA folding and an experimental model of early replication, nonenzymatic template-directed RNA primer extension. Additional study is needed to solve other problems associated with a complete replication cycle, including separation of strands after copying. Interestingly, viroid RNA sequences, which have been suggested to be relics of an RNA World (Diener, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 86:9370-9374, 1989), also show significant asymmetry in folding energy between the infectious (+) and template (-) strands due to G:U pairing, suggesting that this strategy may even be used by replicators in the present day.},

This confirms an earlier report based upon 16S rRNA oligonucleotide cataloging studies (Hensel et al., 1986). Their two lineages form a distinctive grouping within the eubacteria that deserved the taxonomic status of a phylum. The (partial) sequence of T. aquaticus rRNA appears relatively close to those of other thermophilic eubacteria. e.g. Thermotoga maritima and Thermomicrobium roseum. However, this closeness does not reflect a true evolutionary closeness; rather it is due to a "thermophilic convergence", the result of unusually high G+C composition in the rRNAs of thermophilic bacteria. Unless such compositional biases are taken into account, the branching order and root of phylogenetic trees can be incorrectly inferred.},

abstract = {Genetic programs function to integrate environmental sensors, implement signal processing algorithms and control expression dynamics. These programs consist of integrated genetic circuits that individually implement operations ranging from digital logic to dynamic circuits, and they have been used in various cellular engineering applications, including the implementation of process control in metabolic networks and the coordination of spatial differentiation in artificial tissues. A key limitation is that the circuits are based on biochemical interactions occurring in the confined volume of the cell, so the size of programs has been limited to a few circuits. Here we apply part mining and directed evolution to build a set of transcriptional AND gates in Escherichia coli. Each AND gate integrates two promoter inputs and controls one promoter output. This allows the gates to be layered by having the output promoter of an upstream circuit serve as the input promoter for a downstream circuit. Each gate consists of a transcription factor that requires a second chaperone protein to activate the output promoter. Multiple activator-chaperone pairs are identified from type III secretion pathways in different strains of bacteria. Directed evolution is applied to increase the dynamic range and orthogonality of the circuits. These gates are connected in different permutations to form programs, the largest of which is a 4-input AND gate that consists of 3 circuits that integrate 4 inducible systems, thus requiring 11 regulatory proteins. Measuring the performance of individual gates is sufficient to capture the behaviour of the complete program. Errors in the output due to delays (faults), a common problem for layered circuits, are not observed. This work demonstrates the successful layering of orthogonal logic gates, a design strategy that could enable the construction of large, integrated circuits in single cells.},

Previous studies indicate that CypA interacts with influenza virus M1 protein and impairs the early stage of the viral replication. To further understand the molecular mechanism by which CypA impairs influenza virus replication, a 293T cell line depleted for endogenous CypA was established. The results indicated that CypA inhibited the initiation of virus replication. In addition, the infectivity of influenza virus increased in the absence of CypA. Further studies indicated that CypA had no effect on the stages of virus genome replication or transcription and also did not impair the nuclear export of the viral mRNA. However, CypA decreased the viral protein level. Additional studies indicated that CypA enhanced the degradation of M1 through the ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent pathway. Our results suggest that CypA restricts influenza virus replication through accelerating degradation of the M1 protein.},

Previous kinetic studies have shown that the rate of tRNA-mRNA movement is limited by a conformational change in the ribosome termed 'unlocking'. Although structural studies offer some clues as to what unlocking might entail, the molecular basis of this conformational change remains an open question. In this study, the contribution of intersubunit bridges to the energy barrier of translocation was systematically investigated. Unlike those targeting B2a and B3, mutations that disrupt bridges B1a, B4, B7a and B8 increased the maximal rate of both forward (EF-G dependent) and reverse (spontaneous) translocation. As bridge B1a is predicted to constrain 30S head movement and B4, B7a and B8 are predicted to constrain intersubunit rotation, these data provide evidence that formation of the unlocked (transition) state involves both 30S head movement and intersubunit rotation.},

abstract = {With the availability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, it is expected that sequence variants may be called on a genomic scale. Here, we demonstrate that a deeper understanding of the distribution of the variant call frequencies at heterozygous loci in NGS data sets is a prerequisite for sensitive variant detection. We model the crucial steps in an NGS protocol as a stochastic branching process and derive a mathematical framework for the expected distribution of alleles at heterozygous loci before measurement that is sequencing. We confirm our theoretical results by analyzing technical replicates of human exome data and demonstrate that the variance of allele frequencies at heterozygous loci is higher than expected by a simple binomial distribution. Due to this high variance, mutation callers relying on binomial distributed priors are less sensitive for heterozygous variants that deviate strongly from the expected mean frequency. Our results also indicate that error rates can be reduced to a greater degree by technical replicates than by increasing sequencing depth.},

Growth of CSM1 was retarded when it was cultured at 4 degrees C but not when it was cultured at 22 degrees C and 28 degrees C compared to the growth of wild-type cells, indicating that CSM1 is a cold-sensitive mutant of P. syringae Lz4W. The mutated gene in CSM1 was identified as trmE (coding for tRNA modification GTPase), and evidence is provided that this gene is induced at low temperatures. Further, the cold-inducible nature of the trmE promoter was demonstrated. In addition, the transcription start site and the various regulatory elements of the trmE promoter, such as the -10 region, -35 region, UP element, cold box, and DEAD box, were identified, and the importance of these regulatory elements in promoter activity were confirmed. The importance of trmE in rapid adaptation to growth at low temperatures was further highlighted by plasmid-mediated complementation that alleviated the cold-sensitive phenotype of CSM1.},

abstract = {The rapid emergence of bacterial strains resistant to multiple antibiotics is posing a growing public health risk. The mechanisms underlying the rapid evolution of drug resistance are, however, poorly understood. The heterogeneity of the environments in which bacteria encounter antibiotic drugs could play an important role. E.g., in the highly compartmentalized human body, drug levels can vary substantially between different organs and tissues. It has been proposed that this could facilitate the selection of resistant mutants, and recent experiments support this. To study the role of spatial heterogeneity in the evolution of drug resistance, we present a quantitative model describing an environment subdivided into relatively isolated compartments with various antibiotic concentrations, in which bacteria evolve under the stochastic processes of proliferation, migration, mutation and death. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that concentration gradients can foster a mode of adaptation that is impossible in uniform environments. It allows resistant mutants to evade competition and circumvent the slow process of fixation by invading compartments with higher drug concentrations, where less resistant strains cannot subsist. The speed of this process increases sharply with the sensitivity of the growth rate to the antibiotic concentration, which we argue to be generic. Comparable adaptation rates in uniform environments would require a high selection coefficient (s > 0.1) for each forward mutation. Similar processes can occur if the heterogeneity is more complex than just a linear gradient. The model may also be applicable to other adaptive processes involving environmental heterogeneity and range expansion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Halophilic prokaryotes are adapted to thrive in extreme conditions of salinity. Identification and analysis of distinct macromolecular characteristics of halophiles provide insight into the factors responsible for their adaptation to high-salt environments. The current report presents an extensive and systematic comparative analysis of genome and proteome composition of halophilic and non-halophilic microorganisms, with a view to identify such macromolecular signatures of haloadaptation.

RESULTS: Comparative analysis of the genomes and proteomes of halophiles and non-halophiles reveals some common trends in halophiles that transcend the boundary of phylogenetic relationship and the genomic GC-content of the species. At the protein level, halophilic species are characterized by low hydrophobicity, over-representation of acidic residues, especially Asp, under-representation of Cys, lower propensities for helix formation and higher propensities for coil structure. At the DNA level, the dinucleotide abundance profiles of halophilic genomes bear some common characteristics, which are quite distinct from those of non-halophiles, and hence may be regarded as specific genomic signatures for salt-adaptation. The synonymous codon usage in halophiles also exhibits similar patterns regardless of their long-term evolutionary history.

CONCLUSION: The generality of molecular signatures for environmental adaptation of extreme salt-loving organisms, demonstrated in the present study, advocates the convergent evolution of halophilic species towards specific genome and amino acid composition, irrespective of their varying GC-bias and widely disparate taxonomic positions. The adapted features of halophiles seem to be related to physical principles governing DNA and protein stability, in response to the extreme environmental conditions under which they thrive.},

abstract = {A novel barophilic, hyperthermophilic, anaerobic sulfur-metabolizing archaeon, strain MPT (T = type strain), was isolated from a hydrothermal vent site (Snakepit) on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (depth, 3550 m). Enrichments and isolation were done under 40 MPa hydrostatic pressure at 95 degrees C. Strain MPT was barophilic at 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 and 98 degrees C, and was an obligate barophile between 95 and 100 degrees C (Tmax). For growth above 95 degrees C, a pressure of 15.0-17.5 MPa was required. The strain grew at 48-95 degrees C under atmospheric pressure. The optimal temperature for growth was 85 degrees C at both high (40 MPa) and low (0.3 MPa) pressures. The growth rate was twofold higher at 85 degrees C under in situ hydrostatic pressure compared to at low pressure. Strain MPT cells were motile, coccoid, 0.8-2.0 microns in diameter and covered by a hexagonal S-layer lattice. The optimum pH and NaCl concentration for growth at low pressure were 7.0 and 20-30 g l-1, respectively. The new isolate was an obligate heterotroph and utilized yeast extract, beef extract and peptone for growth. Growth was optimal in the presence of elemental sulfur. Rifampicin and chloramphenicol inhibited growth. The core lipids consisted of a major archaeol and a complex lipid pattern consisting of a major phospholipid. The DNA G + C content was 37.1 mol\%. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that strain MPT belonged to the genus Thermococcus and it is proposed that this isolate should be designated as a new species, Thermococcus barophilus.},

Structural and kinetic analyses of these states, made possible by cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), X-ray crystallography, and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET), have provided important insights into the translocation process, which is now understood to proceed, at least in the first step of the process, as a Brownian machine that is transiently stabilized in the 'productive' MS II conformation by the binding of the translocase elongation factor G (EF-G).},

These enzymes are already used in many biotechnological applications requiring high activity at mild temperatures or fast heat-inactivation rate. Most psychrophilic enzymes optimize a high activity at low temperature at the expense of substrate affinity, therefore reducing the free energy barrier of the transition state. Furthermore, a weak temperature dependence of activity ensures moderate reduction of the catalytic activity in the cold. In these naturally evolved enzymes, the optimization to low temperature activity is reached via destabilization of the structures bearing the active site or by destabilization of the whole molecule. This involves a reduction in the number and strength of all types of weak interactions or the disappearance of stability factors, resulting in improved dynamics of active site residues in the cold. Considering the subtle structural adjustments required for low temperature activity, directed evolution appears to be the most suitable methodology to engineer cold activity in biological catalysts.},

During transcription, these two domains compete against each other for shared sequence. In this study, we explore the cooperative effects of ligand binding and Magnesium interactions in the SAM-I riboswitch in the context of aptamer collapse and anti-terminator formation. Overall, our studies show the apo-aptamer acts as (i) a pre-organized aptamer competent to bind ligand and undergo structural collapse and (ii) a conformation that is more accessible to anti-terminator formation. We show that both Mg(2+) ions and SAM are required for a collapse transition to occur. We then use competition between the aptamer and expression platform for shared sequence to characterize the stability of the collapsed aptamer. We find that SAM and Mg(2+) interactions in the aptamer are highly cooperative in maintaining switch polarity (i.e. aptamer 'off-state' versus anti-terminator 'on-state'). We further show that the aptamer off-state is preferentially stabilized by Mg(2+) and similar divalent ions. Furthermore, the functional switching assay was used to select for phosphorothioate interference, and identifies potential magnesium chelation sites while characterizing their coordinated role with SAM in aptamer stabilization. In addition, we find that Mg(2+) interactions with the apo-aptamer are required for the full formation of the anti-terminator structure, and that higher concentrations of Mg(2+) (>4 mM) shift the equilibrium toward the anti-terminator on-state even in the presence of SAM.},

abstract = {Since the early days of molecular evolution, the conventional wisdom has been that the evolution of protein-coding genes is primarily determined by functional constraints. Yet recent evidence indicates that the evolution of these genes is strongly shaped by the biophysical processes of protein synthesis, protein folding, and specific as well as nonspecific protein-protein interactions. Selection pressures related to these biophysical processes affect primarily the amino-acid sequence of genes, but they also leave their mark on synonymous sites at the nucleotide level. While evidence for specific selection pressures related to protein biophysics is strong, there is currently no unifying framework that integrates the various selection pressures on coding sequences and disentangles their relative importance.},

abstract = {To operate in the extreme cold, ion channels from psychrophiles must have evolved structural changes to compensate for their thermal environment. A reasonable assumption would be that the underlying adaptations lie within the encoding genes. Here, we show that delayed rectifier K(+) channel genes from an Antarctic and a tropical octopus encode channels that differ at only four positions and display very similar behavior when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. However, the transcribed messenger RNAs are extensively edited, creating functional diversity. One editing site, which recodes an isoleucine to a valine in the channel's pore, greatly accelerates gating kinetics by destabilizing the open state. This site is extensively edited in both Antarctic and Arctic species, but mostly unedited in tropical species. Thus adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing can respond to the physical environment.},

abstract = {Amplicon sequencing of the hypervariable regions of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene is a widely accepted method for identifying the members of complex bacterial communities. Several rRNA gene sequence reference databases can be used to assign taxonomic names to the sequencing reads using BLAST, USEARCH, GAST or the RDP classifier. Next-generation sequencing methods produce ample reads, but they are short, currently ∼100-450 nt (depending on the technology), as compared to the full rRNA gene of ∼1550 nt. It is important, therefore, to select the right rRNA gene region for sequencing. The primers should amplify the species of interest and the hypervariable regions should differentiate their taxonomy. Here, we introduce TaxMan: a web-based tool that trims reference sequences based on user-selected primer pairs and returns an assessment of the primer specificity by taxa. It allows interactive plotting of taxa, both amplified and missed in silico by the primers used. Additionally, using the trimmed sequences improves the speed of sequence matching algorithms. The smaller database greatly improves run times (up to 98\%) and memory usage, not only of similarity searching (BLAST), but also of chimera checking (UCHIME) and of clustering the reads (UCLUST). TaxMan is available at http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/taxmanwww/.},

abstract = {Four-way junctions (4Hs) are important intermediates in DNA rearrangements such as genetic recombination. Under the influence of multivalent cations these molecules undergo a conformational change, from an extended planar form to a quasi-continuous stacked X-structure. Recently, a number of X-ray structures and a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of 4Hs have been reported and in three of these the position of multivalent cations is revealed. These structures belong to two main families, characterized by the angle between the two co-axial stacked helices, which is either around +40 to +55 degrees or around -70 to -80 degrees. To investigate the role of metal-ion binding on the conformation of folded 4Hs we performed Brownian-dynamics simulations on the set of available structures. The simulations confirm the proposed metal-ion binding sites in the NMR structure and in one of the X-ray structures. Furthermore, the calculations suggest positions for metal-ion binding in the other X-ray structures. The results show a striking dependence of the ion density on the helical environment (B-helix or A-helix) and the structural family.},

abstract = {The penultimate stem-loop of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), helix 44, plays a central role in ribosome function. Using time-resolved dimethyl sulfate (DMS) probing, we have analyzed time-dependent modifications that occur at specific bases in this helix near the decoding region, resulting from the binding of elongation factor G (EF-G) in various forms. When EF-G-GTP is bound to 70S ribosomes, bases A1492 and A1493 are immediately protected, while other bases in the region show either no change or enhanced modification. When apo-EF-G is bound to 70S ribosomes and GTP is added, substantial transient time-dependent enhancement occurs at bases A1492 and A1493, with somewhat less enhancement occurring at base A1483, all in the first 45 ms. When mRNA and deacylated tRNAs are bound to the 70S ribosome and EF-G-GTP is added, bases A1492 and A1493 again show substantial and continued enhancement, while bases A1408, A1413, and A1418 all show time-dependent protection. These results provide primary, real-time evidence that EF-G induces direct or indirect structural changes in this region as EF-G is bound and as GTP is hydrolyzed.},

abstract = {The elongation cycle of protein synthesis involves the delivery of aminoacyl-transfer RNAs to the aminoacyl-tRNA-binding site (A site) of the ribosome, followed by peptide-bond formation and translocation of the tRNAs through the ribosome to reopen the A site. The translocation reaction is catalysed by elongation factor G (EF-G) in a GTP-dependent manner. Despite the availability of structures of various EF-G-ribosome complexes, the precise mechanism by which tRNAs move through the ribosome still remains unclear. Here we use multiparticle cryoelectron microscopy analysis to resolve two previously unseen subpopulations within Thermus thermophilus EF-G-ribosome complexes at subnanometre resolution, one of them with a partly translocated tRNA. Comparison of these substates reveals that translocation of tRNA on the 30S subunit parallels the swivelling of the 30S head and is coupled to unratcheting of the 30S body. Because the tRNA maintains contact with the peptidyl-tRNA-binding site (P site) on the 30S head and simultaneously establishes interaction with the exit site (E site) on the 30S platform, a novel intra-subunit 'pe/E' hybrid state is formed. This state is stabilized by domain IV of EF-G, which interacts with the swivelled 30S-head conformation. These findings provide direct structural and mechanistic insight into the 'missing link' in terms of tRNA intermediates involved in the universally conserved translocation process.},

We have cloned the C. elegans lin-4 locus by chromosomal walking and transformation rescue. We used the C. elegans clone to isolate the gene from three other Caenorhabditis species; all four Caenorhabditis clones functionally rescue the lin-4 null allele of C. elegans. Comparison of the lin-4 genomic sequence from these four species and site-directed mutagenesis of potential open reading frames indicated that lin-4 does not encode a protein. Two small lin-4 transcripts of approximately 22 and 61 nt were identified in C. elegans and found to contain sequences complementary to a repeated sequence element in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of lin-14 mRNA, suggesting that lin-4 regulates lin-14 translation via an antisense RNA-RNA interaction.},

However, the discriminator activity is influenced by flanking regions, in particular in conjunction with the promoter -35 and -10 sequences. In this study, we changed the sequence in the -35 region of the rnpB P-1 promoter to see how such changes affect the stringent control. The sequence variation in the -35 region changed the stringent signal. The change to the consensus TTGACA sequence caused the most prominent relieving effect on stringent repression of the rnpB transcription. The spacing between the -35 and -10 regions is also significant because the relieving effect of the TTGACA was offset by the change of the spacing from 17 to 16 bp. The nucleotide just upstream of the -35 region contributes toward generating stringent signals as well.},

Here we reveal that translation occurs through successive translocation--and-pause cycles. The distribution of pause lengths, with a median of 2.8 s, indicates that at least two rate-determining processes control each pause. Each translocation step measures three bases--one codon-and occurs in less than 0.1 s. Analysis of the times required for translocation reveals, surprisingly, that there are three substeps in each step. Pause lengths, and thus the overall rate of translation, depend on the secondary structure of the mRNA; the applied force destabilizes secondary structure and decreases pause durations, but does not affect translocation times. Translocation and RNA unwinding are strictly coupled ribosomal functions.},

abstract = {Surface charges of proteins have in several cases been found to function as "structural gatekeepers," which avoid unwanted interactions by negative design, for example, in the control of protein aggregation and binding. The question is then if side-chain charges, due to their desolvation penalties, play a corresponding role in protein folding by avoiding competing, misfolded traps? To find out, we removed all 32 side-chain charges from the 101-residue protein S6 from Thermus thermophilus. The results show that the charge-depleted S6 variant not only retains its native structure and cooperative folding transition, but folds also faster than the wild-type protein. In addition, charge removal unleashes pronounced aggregation on longer timescales. S6 provides thus an example where the bias toward native contacts of a naturally evolved protein sequence is independent of charges, and point at a fundamental difference in the codes for folding and intermolecular interaction: specificity in folding is governed primarily by hydrophobic packing and hydrogen bonding, whereas solubility and binding relies critically on the interplay of side-chain charges.},

abstract = {The first bacterial genome was sequenced in 1995, and the first archaeal genome in 1996. Soon after these breakthroughs, an exponential rate of genome sequencing was established, with a doubling time of approximately 20 months for bacteria and approximately 34 months for archaea. Comparative analysis of the hundreds of sequenced bacterial and dozens of archaeal genomes leads to several generalizations on the principles of genome organization and evolution. A crucial finding that enables functional characterization of the sequenced genomes and evolutionary reconstruction is that the majority of archaeal and bacterial genes have conserved orthologs in other, often, distant organisms. However, comparative genomics also shows that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a dominant force of prokaryotic evolution, along with the loss of genetic material resulting in genome contraction. A crucial component of the prokaryotic world is the mobilome, the enormous collection of viruses, plasmids and other selfish elements, which are in constant exchange with more stable chromosomes and serve as HGT vehicles. Thus, the prokaryotic genome space is a tightly connected, although compartmentalized, network, a novel notion that undermines the 'Tree of Life' model of evolution and requires a new conceptual framework and tools for the study of prokaryotic evolution.},

abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion in the number of polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeats in the gene that encodes the huntingtin (htt) protein. A property of the mutant protein that is intimately involved in the development of the disease is the propensity of the glutamine-expanded protein to misfold and generate an N-terminal proteolytic htt fragment that is toxic and prone to aggregation. Intracellular antibodies (intrabodies) against htt have been shown to reduce htt aggregation by binding to the toxic fragment and inactivating it or preventing its misfolding. Intrabodies may therefore be a useful gene-therapy approach to treatment of the disease. However, high levels of intrabody expression have been required to obtain even limited reductions in aggregation. We have engineered a single-domain intracellular antibody against htt for robust aggregation inhibition at low expression levels by increasing its affinity in the absence of a disulfide bond. Furthermore, the engineered intrabody variable light-chain (V(L))12.3, rescued toxicity in a neuronal model of HD. We also found that V(L)12.3 inhibited aggregation and toxicity in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model of HD. V(L)12.3 is significantly more potent than earlier anti-htt intrabodies and is a potential candidate for gene therapy treatment for HD. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to improve affinity in the absence of a disulfide bond to improve intrabody function. The demonstrated importance of disulfide bond-independent binding for intrabody potency suggests a generally applicable approach to the development of effective intrabodies against other intracellular targets.},

abstract = {16S rRNA phylogenetic analysis of a number of yellow- and orange-pigmented strains isolated from a variety of Antarctic habitats including sea ice, lakewater and cyanobacterial mats indicated a close relationship to the genus Flavobacterium but distinct from known Flavobacterium species. Phenotypic properties, DNA G+C content and whole-cell fatty acid profiles of the Antarctic strains were consistent with those of the genus Flavobacterium. DNA-DNA hybridization analysis indicated the presence of two distinct and novel genospecies each isolated from a different Antarctic habitat. From polyphasic taxonomic data it is proposed that the two groups represent new species with the following proposed names: Flavobacterium gillisiae (ACAM 601T) and Flavobacterium tegetincola (ACAM 602T). In addition polyphasic analysis of the species '[Cytophaga] xantha' (Inoue and Komagata 1976), isolated from Antarctic mud, indicated it was a distinct member of the genus Flavobacterium and was thus revived as Flavobacterium xanthum. Phylogenetic and fatty acid analyses also indicate that the species [Flavobacterium] salegens (Dobson et al. 1993), from Organic Lake, Antarctica, is misclassified at the genus level. It is proposed that this species belongs to a new genus, Salegentibacter salegens gen. nov., comb. nov.},

abstract = {Mutations in the human ABCR gene have been associated with the autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP19), and cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) and have also been found in a fraction of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients. The ABCR gene is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily and encodes a rod photoreceptor-specific membrane protein. The cytogenetic location of the ABCR gene was refined to 1p22.3-1p22.2. The intron/exon structure was determined for the ABCR gene from overlapping genomic clones. ABCR spans over 100kb and comprises 50 exons. Intron/exon splice site sequences are presented for all exons and analyzed for information content (Ri). Nine splice site sequence variants found in STGD and AMD patients are evaluated as potential mutations. The localization of splice sites reveals a high degree of conservation between other members of the ABC1 subfamily, e.g. the mouse Abc1 gene. Analysis of the 870-bp 5' upstream of the transcription start sequence reveals multiple putative photoreceptor-specific regulatory elements including a novel retina-specific transcription factor binding site. These results will be useful in further mutational screening of the ABCR gene in various retinopathies and for determining the substrate and/or function of this photoreceptor-specific ABC transporter.},

abstract = {A halo-alkaliphilic, Gram-positive, non-motile bacterium, designated strain 4AGT, was isolated from a mineral pool located in Malvizza, Campania, southern Italy. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain 4AGT was shown to belong to the genus Alkalibacillus within the phylum Firmicutes; its phylogenetic distance from recognized Alkalibacillus species was <95.0 \%. Chemotaxonomic data (MK-7 as the major menaquinone; directly cross-linked meso-diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall; phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol as major polar lipids; iso-C(15 : 0), anteiso-C(15 : 0) and iso-C(17 : 0) as major fatty acids; and glycine betaine and glutamate as major compatible solutes) supported the affiliation of the strain to the genus Alkalibacillus. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization and physiological and biochemical tests allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain 4AGT from the two recognized Alkalibacillus species. Strain 4AGT therefore represents a novel species, for which the name Alkalibacillus filiformis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 4AGT (=DSM 15448T=ATCC BAA-956T).},

abstract = {Two large-scale yeast two-hybrid screens were undertaken to identify protein-protein interactions between full-length open reading frames predicted from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequence. In one approach, we constructed a protein array of about 6,000 yeast transformants, with each transformant expressing one of the open reading frames as a fusion to an activation domain. This array was screened by a simple and automated procedure for 192 yeast proteins, with positive responses identified by their positions in the array. In a second approach, we pooled cells expressing one of about 6,000 activation domain fusions to generate a library. We used a high-throughput screening procedure to screen nearly all of the 6,000 predicted yeast proteins, expressed as Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion proteins, against the library, and characterized positives by sequence analysis. These approaches resulted in the detection of 957 putative interactions involving 1,004 S. cerevisiae proteins. These data reveal interactions that place functionally unclassified proteins in a biological context, interactions between proteins involved in the same biological function, and interactions that link biological functions together into larger cellular processes. The results of these screens are shown here.},

abstract = {Human lipoxygenases and products of their catalytic reaction have a well established connection to many human diseases. Despite their importance in inflammation, cancer, cardiorenal and other ailments the drug development is impaired by the lack of structural details to understand their intricate specificity and function in molecular and cellular signaling. The major effort so far has been directed towards understanding the determinants of their specificity and inhibition of their active site with the iron cofactor. Their structure is believed to consist of only two domains: one regulatory - a beta-sandwich, important for membrane binding, and one, mostly helical, catalytic domain. Although recently published cohort studies on single nucleotide polymorphism and occurrence of diseases, SAXS analysis and new biochemical data throw new light on lipoxygenase suggesting symbiosis of regulatory functions with an allosteric mechanism and more flexible structure than anticipated. The goal of this brief review is to direct an attention to the structural features of an anticipated topology and stimulate discussion/research to prove or disapprove our hypothesis that lipoxygenases may possess about approximately 110 amino acids PDZ-like fragments of functional importance. If they do have a second regulatory domain, it might help to explain their association with other molecules, role in signaling pathways and present a new avenue to explore the regulation of their behavior, and thus intervention in the course of diseases.},

We report a particular folding signature for the riboswitch aptamer whose presence directs the gene-regulatory transcription outcome, and we measured the termination frequency as a function of adenine level and tension applied to the RNA. Our results demonstrate that the outcome is kinetically controlled. These experiments furnish a means to observe conformational switching in real time and enable the precise mapping of events during cotranscriptional folding.},

Examples of newly identified domains include a PWI domain in the U5 snRNP protein 200K (hBrr2, residues 258-338), while examples of previously known domains with a newly determined fold include the DUF1115 domain of the U4/U6 di-snRNP protein 90K (hPrp3, residues 540-683). We also established a non-redundant set of experimental models of spliceosomal proteins, as well as constructed in silico models for regions without an experimental structure. The combined set of structural models is available for download. Altogether, over 90\% of the ordered regions of the spliceosomal proteome can be represented structurally with a high degree of confidence. We analyzed the reduced spliceosomal proteome of the intron-poor organism Giardia lamblia, and as a result, we proposed a candidate set of ordered structural regions necessary for a functional spliceosome. The results of this work will aid experimental and structural analyses of the spliceosomal proteins and complexes, and can serve as a starting point for multiscale modeling of the structure of the entire spliceosome.},

abstract = {Fur is a DNA binding protein that represses bacterial iron uptake systems. Eleven footprinted Escherichia coli Fur binding sites were used to create an initial information theory model of Fur binding, which was then refined by adding 13 experimentally confirmed sites. When the refined model was scanned across all available footprinted sequences, sequence walkers, which are visual depictions of predicted binding sites, frequently appeared in clusters that fit the footprints ( approximately 83\% coverage). This indicated that the model can accurately predict Fur binding. Within the clusters, individual walkers were separated from their neighbors by exactly 3 or 6 bases, consistent with models in which Fur dimers bind on different faces of the DNA helix. When the E. coli genome was scanned, we found 363 unique clusters, which includes all known Fur-repressed genes that are involved in iron metabolism. In contrast, only a few of the known Fur-activated genes have predicted Fur binding sites at their promoters. These observations suggest that Fur is either a direct repressor or an indirect activator. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis Fur models are highly similar to the E. coli Fur model, suggesting that the Fur-DNA recognition mechanism may be conserved for even distantly related bacteria.},

abstract = {Paramutation is a heritable epigenetic modification induced in plants by cross-talk between allelic loci. Here we report a similar modification of the mouse Kit gene in the progeny of heterozygotes with the null mutant Kit(tm1Alf) (a lacZ insertion). In spite of a homozygous wild-type genotype, their offspring maintain, to a variable extent, the white spots characteristic of Kit mutant animals. Efficiently inherited from either male or female parents, the modified phenotype results from a decrease in Kit messenger RNA levels with the accumulation of non-polyadenylated RNA molecules of abnormal sizes. Sustained transcriptional activity at the postmeiotic stages--at which time the gene is normally silent--leads to the accumulation of RNA in spermatozoa. Microinjection into fertilized eggs either of total RNA from Kit(tm1Alf/+) heterozygotes or of Kit-specific microRNAs induced a heritable white tail phenotype. Our results identify an unexpected mode of epigenetic inheritance associated with the zygotic transfer of RNA molecules.},

abstract = {Synonymous codons are unevenly distributed among genes, a phenomenon termed codon usage bias. Understanding the patterns of codon bias and the forces shaping them is a major step towards elucidating the adaptive advantage codon choice can confer at the level of individual genes and organisms. Here, we perform a large-scale analysis to assess codon usage bias pattern of pyrimidine-ending codons in highly expressed genes in prokaryotes. We find a bias pattern linked to the degeneracy of the encoded amino acid. Specifically, we show that codon-pairs that encode two- and three-fold degenerate amino acids are biased towards the C-ending codon while codons encoding four-fold degenerate amino acids are biased towards the U-ending codon. This codon usage pattern is widespread in prokaryotes, and its strength is correlated with translational selection both within and between organisms. We show that this bias is associated with an improved correspondence with the tRNA pool, avoidance of mis-incorporation errors during translation and moderate stability of codon-anticodon interaction, all consistent with more efficient translation.},

abstract = {Concentrated extracts of Halobacterium cutirubrum were prepared at 0 C by gently disrupting cells with a nonionic detergent in a medium containing 3.0 m KCl, 0.5 m NH(4)Cl, and 0.04 m (or more) magnesium acetate and then treating the gelatinous mass with deoxyribonuclease. On KCl-sucrose gradients containing 0.5 m NH(4)Cl and 0.04 m magnesium acetate, these extracts showed 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits plus a flat profile of faster-sedimenting material up to high S values. Only after frozen storage or brief incubation of the extract were 70S ribosomes and distinct classes of small polyribosomes detected. Digestion with ribonuclease converted faster-sedimenting material to 70S particles. The presence of chloramphenicol during preparation of the extracts did not affect these results. The evidence suggests that ribosomal particles exist in these cells as subunits or as polyribosomes but not as 70S ribosomes. To investigate the function of Mg(++) and NH(4) (+) ions in ribosomal complexes from this halophile, concentrated cell extracts and extracts incubated with (14)C-leucine were examined on KCl-sucrose gradients containing different concentrations of these ions. Polyribosomes and the bulk of 70S ribosomes dissociated reversibly to subunits at about 0.01 m Mg(++), whereas a small fraction of the 70S particles, including those which in vitro incorporated (14)C-leucine into nascent protein, dissociated only below 1 mm Mg(++). Below this concentration of Mg(++), nascent protein remained attached to the 50S subunit even at 0.04 mm Mg(++) in the presence of 0.35 to 0.5 m NH(4)Cl. Nascent protein, presumably as peptidyl-transfer ribonucleic acid, dissociated reversibly from 50S subunits only at 0.04 mm Mg(++) and 0.1 m or less NH(4) (+). Thus, the stability of polyribosomes from H. cutirubrum depends specifically on both Mg(++) and NH(4) (+) ions.},

abstract = {The ribosome is a complex macromolecular machine responsible for protein synthesis in the cell. It consists of two subunits, each of which contains both RNA and protein components. Ribosome assembly is subject to intricate regulatory control and is aided by a multitude of assembly factors in vivo, but can also be carried out in vitro. The details of the assembly process remain unknown even in the face of atomic structures of the entire ribosome and after more than three decades of research. Some of the earliest research on ribosome assembly produced the Nomura assembly map of the small subunit, revealing a hierarchy of protein binding dependencies for the 20 proteins involved and suggesting the possibility of a single intermediate. Recent work using a combination of RNA footprinting and pulse-chase quantitative mass spectrometry paints a picture of small subunit assembly as a dynamic and varied landscape, with sequential and hierarchical RNA folding and protein binding events finally converging on complete subunits. Proteins generally lock tightly into place in a 5' to 3' direction along the ribosomal RNA, stabilizing transient RNA conformations, while RNA folding and the early stages of protein binding are initiated from multiple locations along the length of the RNA.},

abstract = {Psychrophiles, host of permanently cold habitats, display metabolic fluxes comparable to those exhibited by mesophilic organisms at moderate temperatures. These organisms have evolved by producing, among other peculiarities, cold-active enzymes that have the properties to cope with the reduction of chemical reaction rates induced by low temperatures. The emerging picture suggests that these enzymes display a high catalytic efficiency at low temperatures through an improved flexibility of the structural components involved in the catalytic cycle, whereas other protein regions, if not implicated in catalysis, may be even more rigid than their mesophilic counterparts. In return, the increased flexibility leads to a decreased stability of psychrophilic enzymes. In order to gain further advances in the analysis of the activity/flexibility/stability concept, psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic DNA ligases have been compared by three-dimensional-modeling studies, as well as regards their activity, surface hydrophobicity, structural permeability, conformational stabilities, and irreversible thermal unfolding. These data show that the cold-adapted DNA ligase is characterized by an increased activity at low and moderate temperatures, an overall destabilization of the molecular edifice, especially at the active site, and a high conformational flexibility. The opposite trend is observed in the mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts, the latter being characterized by a reduced low temperature activity, high stability and reduced flexibility. These results strongly suggest a complex relationship between activity, flexibility and stability. In addition, they also indicate that in cold-adapted enzymes, the driving force for denaturation is a large entropy change.},

The bacterial cells were pale-pink-pigmented, Gram-negative, obligately aerobic, non-spore-forming, spherical and non-motile. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the novel isolate was a member of the phylum 'Verrucomicrobia' and shared approximately 84-87 \% sequence similarity with strains of the class Opitutae that have been cultivated to date. Strain YM26-026(T) produced pale-pink pigments of carotenoid. beta-Lactam antibiotic susceptibility tests and amino acid analysis of cell-wall hydrolysates indicated that the novel isolate did not contain muramic acid or diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall, suggesting that the strain lacks peptidoglycan. The G+C content of the DNA of strain YM26-026(T) was 54.0 mol\%. Menaquinone-7 was the major quinone and C(14 : 0) and C(18 : 1)omega9c were the major fatty acids. On the basis of polyphasic taxonomic studies, it was concluded that strain YM26-026(T) represents a new genus of the family Puniceicoccaceae within the phylum 'Verrucomicrobia', for which the name Cerasicoccus arenae gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YM26-026(T) (=MBIC08280(T)=KCTC 12870(T)).},

Cells of strain RT8-4 are irregular cocci with peritrechous flagella. The strain grows aerobically in either a lithotrophic or a heterotrophic mode. No anaerobic growth is apparent. Growth on elemental sulfur occurs through the oxidation of sulfur. Strain RT8-4 is capable of utilizing tryptone, d-xylose, d-arabinose, d-galactose, maltose, sucrose, d-fructose, or l-glutamic acid as the sole source of carbon. d-Glucose and d-mannose are not utilized. RT8-4 grows optimally at 85 degrees C and pH 3.5. The G+C content of the genome of RT8-4 is 34.4 mol\%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequence as well as DNA-DNA hybridization and phenotypic characterization identifies strain RT8-4 as a novel species in the genus Sulfolobus.

abstract = {XPC DNA repair gene mutations result in the cancer-prone disorder xeroderma pigmentosum. The XPC gene spans 33 kb and has 16 exons (82-882 bp) and 15 introns (0.08-5.4 kb). A 1.6 kb intron was found within exon 5. Sensitive real- time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction methods were developed to measure full-length XPC mRNA (the predominant form) and isoforms that skipped exons 4, 7 or 12. Exon 7 was skipped in approximately 0.07\% of XPC mRNAs, consistent with the high information content of the exon 7 splice acceptor and donor sites (12.3 and 10.4 bits). In contrast, exon 4 was skipped in approximately 0.7\% of the XPC mRNAs, consistent with the low information content of the exon 4 splice acceptor (-0.1 bits). A new common C/A single nucleotide polymorphism in the XPC intron 11 splice acceptor site (58\% C in 97 normals) decreased its information content from 7.5 to 5.1 bits. Fibroblasts homozygous for A/A had significantly higher levels (approximately 2.6-fold) of the XPC mRNA isoform that skipped exon 12 than those homozygous for C/C. This abnormally spliced XPC mRNA isoform has diminished DNA repair function and may contribute to cancer susceptibility.},

Isostericity Matrices are used to analyze structurally the sequence variations of the characteristic non-Watson-Crick base pairs for each motif. We show that Isostericity Matrices for non-Watson-Crick base pairs provide important tools for deriving the sequence signatures of recurrent motifs, for scoring and refining sequence alignments, and for determining whether motifs are conserved throughout evolution. The systematic use of Isostericity Matrices identifies the positions of the insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides relative to the structurally characterized examples of motifs and, most importantly, specifies whether these changes result in new motifs. Thus, comparative analysis coupled with Isostericity Matrices allows one to produce and refine structural sequence alignments. The analysis, based on both sequence and structure, permits therefore the evaluation of the conservation of motifs across phylogeny and the derivation of rules of equivalence between structural motifs. The conservations observed in Isostericity Matrices form a predictive basis for identifying motifs in sequences.},

In contrast to a control flat surface, which exhibited pronounced stick-slip motion accompanied with high friction, the fibrillar microstructure demonstrated a stable and smooth sliding with a friction coefficient approximately four times lower. The structured contact also manifested zero pull-off force in a sheared state, while the flat surface exhibited highly scattered and unreliable pull-off force when affected by contact shearing. It appears that the fibrillar microstructure can be used in applications where a total attachment force should be generated in a binary on/off state and, most surprisingly, is suitable to stabilize and minimize elastomer friction.},

abstract = {Understanding how a simple chemical system can accurately replicate combinatorial information, such as a sequence, is an important question for both the study of life in the universe and for the development of evolutionary molecular design techniques. During biological sequence replication, a nucleic acid polymer serves as a template for the enzyme-catalyzed assembly of a complementary sequence. Enzymes then separate the template and complement before the next round of replication. Attempts to understand how replication could occur more simply, such as without enzymes, have largely focused on developing minimal versions of this replication process. Here we describe how a different mechanism, crystal growth and scission, can accurately replicate chemical sequences without enzymes. Crystal growth propagates a sequence of bits while mechanically-induced scission creates new growth fronts. Together, these processes exponentially increase the number of crystal sequences. In the system we describe, sequences are arrangements of DNA tile monomers within ribbon-shaped crystals. 99.98\% of bits are copied correctly and 78\% of 4-bit sequences are correct after two generations; roughly 40 sequence copies are made per growth front per generation. In principle, this process is accurate enough for 1,000-fold replication of 4-bit sequences with 50\% yield, replication of longer sequences, and darwinian evolution. We thus demonstrate that neither enzymes nor covalent bond formation are required for robust chemical sequence replication. The form of the replicated information is also compatible with the replication and evolution of a wide class of materials with precise nanoscale geometry such as plasmonic nanostructures or heterogeneous protein assemblies.},

abstract = {The intent of this article is to provide a critical assessment of our current understanding of life's phylogenetic diversity. Phylogenetic comparison of gene sequences is a natural way to identify microorganisms and can also be used to infer the course of evolution. Three decades of molecular phylogenetic studies with various molecular markers have provided the outlines of a universal tree of life (ToL), the three-domain pattern of archaea, bacteria, and eucarya. The sequence-based perspective on microbial identification additionally opened the way to the identification of environmental microbes without the requirement for culture, particularly through analysis of rRNA gene sequences. Environmental rRNA sequences, which now far outnumber those from cultivars, expand our knowledge of the extent of microbial diversity and contribute increasingly heavily to the emerging ToL. Although the three-domain structure of the ToL is established, the deep phylogenetic structure of each of the domains remains murky and sometimes controversial. Obstacles to accurate inference of deep phylogenetic relationships are both systematic, in molecular phylogenetic calculations, and practical, due to a paucity of sequence representation for many groups of organisms.},

abstract = {Given the considerable promise whole-genome sequencing offers for phylogeny and classification, it is surprising that microbial systematics and genomics have not yet been reconciled. This might be due to the intrinsic difficulties in inferring reasonable phylogenies from genomic sequences, particularly in the light of the significant amount of lateral gene transfer in prokaryotic genomes. However, recent studies indicate that the species tree and the hierarchical classification based on it are still meaningful concepts, and that state-of-the-art phylogenetic inference methods are able to provide reliable estimates of the species tree to the benefit of taxonomy. Conversely, we suspect that the current lack of completely sequenced genomes for many of the major lineages of prokaryotes and for most type strains is a major obstacle in progress towards a genome-based classification of microorganisms. We conclude that phylogeny-driven microbial genome sequencing projects such as the Genomic Encyclopaedia of Archaea and Bacteria (GEBA) project are likely to rectify this situation.},

abstract = {To ensure the accuracy of gene expression, eukaryotes have evolved several surveillance mechanisms. One of the best-studied quality control mechanisms is nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which recognizes and degrades transcripts harboring a premature translation-termination codon (PTC), thereby preventing the production of faulty proteins. NMD regulates approximately 10\% of human mRNAs, and its physiological importance is manifested by the fact that approximately 30\% of disease-associated mutations generate PTCs. Although different mechanisms of PTC recognition have been proposed for different species, recent studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, plants and mammals suggest a conserved model. Here, we summarize the latest results and discuss an emerging model for NMD and its implications for the regulation of gene expression.},

abstract = {Two strains of obligately piezophilic bacteria were isolated from sediment collected from the bottom surface of a small canyon on the seaward slope of the Japan Trench at a depth of 6278 m. The isolated strains, Y223GT and Y251E, are closely affiliated with members of the genus Colwellia on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The G + C contents of both strains were about 39 mol\%. DNA-DNA hybridization values between these strains and Colwellia reference strains were significantly lower than those accepted as the phylogenetic definition of a species. The novel strains are Gram-negative, polarly flagellated and facultatively anaerobic. The optimal pressure for growth was 60 MPa at both 4 and 10 degrees C; the most rapid growth rate was observed at 10 degrees C and 60 MPa. No growth occurred at 15 degrees C under any pressure studied. The major isoprenoid quinone is Q-8. The predominant cellular fatty acids are C16 : 0 and C16 : 1. Based on the taxonomic differences observed, the isolated strains appear to represent a novel obligately piezophilic Colwellia species. The name Colwellia piezophila sp. nov. (type strain Y223GT = JCM 11831T = ATCC BAA-637T) is proposed.},

Cells of the strain were Gram-negative, short to elongated rods that were orange-coloured but negative for flexirubin-type pigments, obligately aerobic, chemoheterotrophic and devoid of gliding or flagellar motility. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons, the strain was closely related to members of the genus Lewinella (86.3-93.1 \%) of the family 'Saprospiraceae' in the phylum Bacteroidetes; the most closely related species was Lewinella lutea (93.1 \% similarity to the type strain). The DNA G+C content of the strain was 50.3 mol\% and the major respiratory quinone was MK-7. The predominant cellular fatty acids were C(16 : 1)omega7c/iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH (39.4 \%), iso-C(15 : 0) (15.9 \%), C(17 : 1)omega7c (10.5 \%) and C(15 : 1)omega6c (8.9 \%). 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses and the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic tests allowed the differentiation of strain IMCC3223T from all recognized species of the genus Lewinella. Therefore, strain IMCC3223T represents a novel species of the genus Lewinella, for which the name Lewinella antarctica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IMCC3223T (=KCCM 42688T =NBRC 103142T).},

@article{Krzyzaniak1994,
abstract = {This paper shows that the phenylalanine-specific tRNA of Escherichia coli as well as the yellow lupin methionine initiator tRNAMet can be charged specifically with phenylalanine and methionine, respectively, in the absence of specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, under high pressure of a maximum of 6 kbar (1 bar = 10(5) Pa; 1 atm = 1.01 x 10(5) Pa). The esterification reaction takes places at the 3' end of the tRNA molecules. The yield of Phe-tRNAPhe or Met-tRNAMet at high pressure is approximately 10 times lower than that of the enzymatic aminoacylation reaction. This reaction seems to be specific, and mis-aminoacylation of tRNAPhe and tRNAMet with serine is negligible. It is well known that tRNA undergoes conformational changes during interaction with an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Similarly, on the basis of circular dichroism spectra, we showed that the conformation of tRNA at high pressure differs slightly from its original A-RNA form. Therefore, it can be speculated that the chargeable conformation of tRNA induced by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase during enzymatic aminoacylation and the one created at high pressure are similar and are most probably formed by a dehydration mechanism. We think that the 'unique' tertiary structure of tRNA existing under high pressure creates an active centre which might itself catalyse ester bond formation. Therefore, the structure of the amino acid stem of tRNA may determine (code) the charging of the particular amino acid to specific tRNA. This code is clearly distinct from the rules of the classical genetic code.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Experimental evidence has accumulated showing that microRNA (miRNA) binding sites within protein coding sequences (CDSs) are functional in controlling gene expression. RESULTS: Here we report a computational analysis of such miRNA target sites, based on features extracted from existing mammalian high throughput immunoprecipitation and sequencing data. The analysis is performed independently for the CDS and the 3' Untranslated Regions (3'UTRs) and reveals different sets of features and models for the two regions. The two models are combined into a novel computational model for miRNA target genes, DIANA-microT-CDS, which achieves higher sensitivity compared to other popular programs and the model that uses only the 3'UTR target sites. Further analysis indicates that genes with shorter 3'UTRs are preferentially targeted in the CDS, suggesting that evolutionary selection might favor additional sites on the CDS in cases where there is restricted space on the 3'UTR. AVAILABILITY: The results of DIANA-microT-CDS are available at www.microrna.gr/microT-CDS.

abstract = {Spatial and functional organization of cells in tissues is determined by cell-cell adhesion, thought to be initiated through trans-interactions between extracellular domains of the cadherin family of adhesion proteins, and strengthened by linkage to the actin cytoskeleton. Prevailing dogma is that cadherins are linked to the actin cytoskeleton through beta-catenin and alpha-catenin, although the quaternary complex has never been demonstrated. We test this hypothesis and find that alpha-catenin does not interact with actin filaments and the E-cadherin-beta-catenin complex simultaneously, even in the presence of the actin binding proteins vinculin and alpha-actinin, either in solution or on isolated cadherin-containing membranes. Direct analysis in polarized cells shows that mobilities of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and alpha-catenin are similar, regardless of the dynamic state of actin assembly, whereas actin and several actin binding proteins have higher mobilities. These results suggest that the linkage between the cadherin-catenin complex and actin filaments is more dynamic than previously appreciated.},

abstract = {Scientific and technological advances that enable the tuning of integrated regulatory components to match network and system requirements are critical to reliably control the function of biological systems. RNA provides a promising building block for the construction of tunable regulatory components based on its rich regulatory capacity and our current understanding of the sequence-function relationship. One prominent example of RNA-based regulatory components is riboswitches, genetic elements that mediate ligand control of gene expression through diverse regulatory mechanisms. While characterization of natural and synthetic riboswitches has revealed that riboswitch function can be modulated through sequence alteration, no quantitative frameworks exist to investigate or guide riboswitch tuning. Here, we combined mathematical modeling and experimental approaches to investigate the relationship between riboswitch function and performance. Model results demonstrated that the competition between reversible and irreversible rate constants dictates performance for different regulatory mechanisms. We also found that practical system restrictions, such as an upper limit on ligand concentration, can significantly alter the requirements for riboswitch performance, necessitating alternative tuning strategies. Previous experimental data for natural and synthetic riboswitches as well as experiments conducted in this work support model predictions. From our results, we developed a set of general design principles for synthetic riboswitches. Our results also provide a foundation from which to investigate how natural riboswitches are tuned to meet systems-level regulatory demands.},

Antisense deoxyoligonucleotides were microinjected into Xenopus oocytes to deplete the endogenous pool of U8 RNA.

The two strains had similar chemotaxonomic characteristics, with menaquinone 7 as the major quinone system, 47.2-48.9 mol\% DNA G+C content and 15 : 0 iso, 15 : 1 iso, 17 : 0 iso 3-OH and summed feature 3 as the major fatty acids.

abstract = {Five decades of research have identified more than 100 ribonucleosides that are post-transcriptionally modified. Many modified nucleosides are conserved throughout bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, while some are unique to each branch of life. However, the cellular and functional dynamics of RNA modification remain largely unexplored, mostly because of the lack of functional hypotheses and experimental methods for quantification and large-scale analysis. Many RNA modifications are not essential for life, which parallels the observation that many well-characterized protein and DNA modifications are not essential for life. Instead, increasing evidence indicates that RNA modifications can play regulatory roles in cells, especially in response to stress conditions. In this Account, we review some examples of RNA modification that are dynamically controlled in cells. We also discuss some recently developed methods that have enhanced the ability to study the cellular dynamics of RNA modification. We discuss four specific examples of RNA modification in detail here. We begin with 4-thio uridine (s(4)U), which can act as a cellular sensor of near-UV light. Then we consider queuosine (Q), which is a potential biomarker for malignancy. Next we examine N(6)-methyl adenine (m(6)A), which is the prevalent modification in eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Finally, we discuss pseudouridine ($\psi$), which is inducible by nutrient deprivation. We then consider two recent technical advances that have stimulated the study of the cellular dynamics in modified ribonucleosides. The first is a genome-wide method that combines primer extension with a microarray. It was used to study the N(1)-methyl adenine (m(1)A) hypomodification in human transfer RNA (tRNA). The second is a quantitative mass spectrometric method used to investigate dynamic changes in a wide range of tRNA modifications under stress conditions in yeast. In addition, we discuss potential mechanisms that control dynamic regulation of RNA modifications as well as hypotheses for discovering potential RNA demodification enzymes. We conclude by highlighting the need to develop new tools and to generate additional hypotheses for how these modifications function in cells. The study of the cellular dynamics of modified RNA remains a largely open area for new development, which underscores the rich potential for important advances as researchers drive this emerging field to the next level.},

@article{Heimberg2008,
abstract = {The causal basis of vertebrate complexity has been sought in genome duplication events (GDEs) that occurred during the emergence of vertebrates, but evidence beyond coincidence is wanting. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been identified as a viable causal factor in increasing organismal complexity through the action of these approximately 22-nt noncoding RNAs in regulating gene expression. Because miRNAs are continuously being added to animalian genomes, and, once integrated into a gene regulatory network, are strongly conserved in primary sequence and rarely secondarily lost, their evolutionary history can be accurately reconstructed. Here, using a combination of Northern analyses and genomic searches, we show that 41 miRNA families evolved at the base of Vertebrata, as they are found and/or detected in lamprey, but not in either ascidians or amphioxus (or any other nonchordate taxon). When placed into temporal context, the rate of miRNA acquisition and the extent of phenotypic evolution are anomalously high early in vertebrate history, far outstripping any other episode in chordate evolution. The genomic position of miRNA paralogues in humans, together with gene trees incorporating lamprey orthologues, indicates that although GDEs can account for an increase in the diversity of miRNA family members, which occurred before the last common ancestor of all living vertebrates, GDEs cannot account for the origin of these novel families themselves. We hypothesize that lying behind the origin of vertebrate complexity is the dramatic expansion of the noncoding RNA inventory including miRNAs, rather than an increase in the protein-encoding inventory caused by GDEs.},

@article{Azad2004,
abstract = {In this paper, we review developments in probabilistic methods of gene recognition in prokaryotic genomes with the emphasis on connections to the general theory of hidden Markov models (HMM). We show that the Bayesian method implemented in GeneMark, a frequently used gene-finding tool, can be augmented and reintroduced as a rigorous forward-backward (FB) algorithm for local posterior decoding described in the HMM theory. Another earlier developed method, prokaryotic GeneMark.hmm, uses a modification of the Viterbi algorithm for HMM with duration to identify the most likely global path through hidden functional states given the DNA sequence. GeneMark and GeneMark.hmm programs are worth using in concert for analysing prokaryotic DNA sequences that arguably do not follow any exact mathematical model. The new extension of GeneMark using the FB algorithm was implemented in the software program GeneMark.fba. Given the DNA sequence, this program determines an a posteriori probability for each nucleotide to belong to coding or non-coding region. Also, for any open reading frame (ORF), it assigns a score defined as a probabilistic measure of all paths through hidden states that traverse the ORF as a coding region. The prediction accuracy of GeneMark.fba determined in our tests was compared favourably to the accuracy of the initial (standard) GeneMark program. Comparison to the prokaryotic GeneMark.hmm has also demonstrated a certain, yet species-specific, degree of improvement in raw gene detection, ie detection of correct reading frame (and stop codon). The accuracy of exact gene prediction, which is concerned about precise prediction of gene start (which in a prokaryotic genome unambiguously defines the reading frame and stop codon, thus, the whole protein product), still remains more accurate in GeneMarkS, which uses more elaborate HMM to specifically address this task.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional (3D) structures of many biomacromolecules have been solved to reveal the functions of these molecules. However, these 3D structures have rarely been applied to constructing efficient molecular devices that function in living cells. Here, we demonstrate a 3D structure-based molecular design principle for constructing short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated genetic information converters; these converters respond to specific proteins and trigger the desired gene expression by modulating the function of the RNA-processing enzyme Dicer. The inhibitory effect on Dicer cleavage against the shRNA designed to specifically bind to U1A spliceosomal protein was correlated with the degree of steric hindrance between Dicer and the shRNA-protein complex in vitro: The level of the hindrance was predicted based on the models. Moreover, the regulation of gene expression was achieved by using the shRNA converters designed to bind to the target U1A or nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) p50 proteins expressed in human cells. The 3D molecular design approach is widely applicable for developing new devices in synthetic biology.},

abstract = {Cold tolerant strains of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans play a role in metal leaching and acid mine drainage (AMD) production in northern latitude/boreal mining environments. In this study we used a proteomics and bioinformatics approach to decipher the proteome changes related to sustained growth at low temperatures to increase our understanding of cold adaptation mechanisms in A. ferrooxidans strains. Changes in protein abundance in response to low temperatures (5 and 15°C) were monitored and protein analyses of a psychrotrophic strain (D6) versus a mesophilic strain (F1) showed that both strains increased levels of 11 stress-related and metabolic proteins including survival protein SurA, trigger factor Tig, and AhpC-Tsa antioxidant proteins. However, a unique set of changes in the proteome of psychrotrophic strain D6 were observed. In particular, the importance of protein fate, membrane transport and structure for psychrotrophic growth were evident with increases in numerous chaperone and transport proteins including GroEL, SecB, ABC transporters and a capsule polysaccharide export protein. We also observed that low temperature iron oxidation coincides with a relative increase in the key iron metabolism protein rusticyanin, which was more highly expressed in strain D6 than in strain F1 at colder growth temperatures. We demonstrate that the psychrotrophic strain uses a global stress response and cold-active metabolism which permit growth of A. ferrooxidans in the extreme AMD environment in colder climates.},

abstract = {Curation of biomedical literature is often supported by the automatic analysis of textual content that generally involves a sequence of individual processing components. Text mining (TM) has been used to enhance the process of manual biocuration, but has been focused on specific databases and tasks rather than an environment integrating TM tools into the curation pipeline, catering for a variety of tasks, types of information and applications. Processing components usually come from different sources and often lack interoperability. The well established Unstructured Information Management Architecture is a framework that addresses interoperability by defining common data structures and interfaces. However, most of the efforts are targeted towards software developers and are not suitable for curators, or are otherwise inconvenient to use on a higher level of abstraction. To overcome these issues we introduce Argo, an interoperable, integrative, interactive and collaborative system for text analysis with a convenient graphic user interface to ease the development of processing workflows and boost productivity in labour-intensive manual curation. Robust, scalable text analytics follow a modular approach, adopting component modules for distinct levels of text analysis. The user interface is available entirely through a web browser that saves the user from going through often complicated and platform-dependent installation procedures. Argo comes with a predefined set of processing components commonly used in text analysis, while giving the users the ability to deposit their own components. The system accommodates various areas and levels of user expertise, from TM and computational linguistics to ontology-based curation. One of the key functionalities of Argo is its ability to seamlessly incorporate user-interactive components, such as manual annotation editors, into otherwise completely automatic pipelines. As a use case, we demonstrate the functionality of an in-built manual annotation editor that is well suited for in-text corpus annotation tasks. Database URL: http://www.nactem.ac.uk/Argo.},

abstract = {In multicellular organisms both health and disease are defined by patterns of communication between the constituent cells. In addition to networks of soluble mediators, cells are also programed to exchange complex messages pre-assembled as multimolecular cargo of membraneous structures known extracellular vesicles (EV). Several biogenetic pathways produce EVs with different properties, and known as exosomes, ectosomes, and apoptotic bodies. In cancer, EVs carry molecular signatures and effectors of the disease, such as mutant oncoproteins, oncogenic transcripts, microRNA, and DNA sequences. Intercellular trafficking of such EVs (oncosomes) may contribute to horizontal cellular transformation, phenotypic reprograming, and functional re-education of recipient cells, both locally and systemically. The EV-mediated, reciprocal molecular exchange also includes tumor suppressors, phosphoproteins, proteases, growth factors, and bioactive lipids, all of which participate in the functional integration of multiple cells and their collective involvement in tumor angiogenesis, inflammation, immunity, coagulopathy, mobilization of bone marrow-derived effectors, metastasis, drug resistance, or cellular stemness. In cases where the EV role is rate limiting their production and uptake may represent and unexplored anticancer therapy target. Moreover, oncosomes circulating in biofluids of cancer patients offer an unprecedented, remote, and non-invasive access to crucial molecular information about cancer cells, including their driver mutations, classifiers, molecular subtypes, therapeutic targets, and biomarkers of drug resistance. New nanotechnologies are being developed to exploit this unique biomarker platform. Indeed, embracing the notion that human cancers are defined not only by processes occurring within cancer cells, but also between them, and amidst the altered tumor and systemic microenvironment may open new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities.},

abstract = {Rnt1p is an RNase III homolog from budding yeast, required for processing snRNAs, snoRNAs, and rRNA. Numerous Rnt1p RNA substrates share potential to form a duplex structure with a terminal four-base loop with the sequence AGNN. Using a synthetic RNA modeled after the 25S rRNA 3' ETS cleavage site we find that the AGNN loop is an important determinant of substrate selectivity. When this loop sequence is altered, the rate of Rnt1p cleavage is reduced. The reduction in cleavage rate can be attributed to reduced binding of the mutant substrate as measured by a gel-shift assay. Deletion of the nonconserved N-terminal domain of Rnt1p does not affect cleavage site choice or the ability of the enzyme to distinguish substrates that contain the AGNN loop, indicating that this region is not required for selective cleavage. Strikingly, a recombinant fragment of Rnt1p containing little more than the dsRBD is able to discriminate between wild-type and mutant loop sequences in a binding assay. We propose that a major determinant of AGNN loop recognition by Rnt1p is present in its dsRBD.},

Polyphasic taxonomy was performed, including API20 NE and API50 CH bacterial identification kits, Biolog analysis, lipids and fatty acid analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization, 16S rRNA and cpn60 gene sequence analyses. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain CR11(T) belonged to the genus Sphingobacterium and was closely related to Sphingobacterium multivorum IFO 14947(T) (98\% similarity) and Sphingobacterium. thalpophilum ATCC 43320(T) (97\% similarity). DNA-DNA hybridization showed 11\% and 13\% DNA re-association with S. multivorum LMG 8342(T) and S. thalpophilum LMG 11520(T), respectively. Major fatty acids (16:0, 15:0 iso and 17:0 iso 3-OH) and the G+C content of the DNA (40.5 mol\%), were also similar to those of the genus Sphingobacterium. The predominant respiratory quinone was MK-7. In all analyses, including phenotypic characterization, this isolate was found to be different from the closely related species, S. multivorum and S. thalpophilum. On the basis of these results, this strain represents a new species within the genus Sphingobacterium. The name Sphingobacterium canadense sp. nov. is suggested and the type strain is CR11(T) (=NCCB 100125(T)=LMG 23727(T)).},

abstract = {The synthesis of ribosomal RNA is the rate-limiting step in ribosome synthesis in bacteria. There are multiple mechanisms that determine the rate of rRNA synthesis. Ribosomal RNA promoter sequences have evolved for exceptional strength and for regulation in response to nutritional conditions and amino acid availability. Strength derives in part from an extended RNA polymerase (RNAP) recognition region involving at least two RNAP subunits, in part from activation by a transcription factor and in part from modification of the transcript by a system that prevents premature termination. Regulation derives from at least two mechanistically distinct systems, growth rate-dependent control and stringent control. The mechanisms contributing to rRNA transcription work together and compensate for one another when individual systems are rendered inoperative.},

@article{Wallace2008,
abstract = {We reexamine Eigen's paradox using the asymptotic limit theorems of information theory. Applying the homology between information source uncertainty and free energy density, under rate distortion constraints, the error catastrophe emerges as the lowest energy state for simple prebiotic systems without error correction. Invoking the usual compartmentalization--i.e., 'vesicles'--and using a Red Queen argument, suggests that information crosstalk between two or more properly interacting structures can initiate a coevolutionary dynamic having at least two quasi-stable states. The first is a low energy realm near the error threshold, and, depending on available energy, the second can approach zero error as a limit. A large deviations argument produces jet-like global transitions which, over sufficient time, may enable shifts between the many quasi-stable modes available to more complicated structures, 'locking in' to some subset of the various possible low error rate chemical systems, which become subject to development by selection and chance extinction. Energy availability, according to the model, is thus a powerful necessary condition for low error rate replication, suggesting that some fundamental prebiotic ecosystem transformation entrained reproductive fidelity. This work, then, supports speculation that our RNA/DNA world may indeed be only the chance result of a very broad prebiotic evolutionary phenomenon. Processes in vitro, or ex planeta, might have other outcomes.},

Our method locates all favorable structural states of a model RNA of significant complexity while improving sampling accuracy and increasing speed many fold over existing all-atom RNA modeling methods. We also modeled the effects of sequence mutations on the structural building blocks of tRNA-based nanotechnology. With its flexibility in choosing arbitrary degrees of freedom as well as in allowing different all-atom energy functions, MOSAICS is an ideal tool to model and design biomolecules of the nanoscale.},

abstract = {By optimizing binding to a selected target protein, modern drug research strives to develop safe and efficacious agents for the treatment of disease. Selective drug action is intended to minimize undesirable side effects from scatter pharmacology. Celecoxib (Celebrex), valdecoxib (Bextra), and rofecoxib (Vioxx) are nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) due to selective inhibition of inducible cyclooxygenase COX-2 while sparing inhibition of constitutive COX-1. While rofecoxib contains a methyl sulfone constituent, celecoxib and valdecoxib possess an unsubstituted arylsulfonamide moiety. The latter group is common to many carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors. Using enzyme kinetics and X-ray crystallography, we demonstrate an unexpected nanomolar affinity of the COX-2 specific arylsulfonamide-type celecoxib and valdecoxib for isoenzymes of the totally unrelated carbonic anhydrase (CA) family, such as CA I, II, IV, and IX, whereas the rofecoxib methyl sulfone-type has no effect. When administered orally to glaucomatous rabbits, celecoxib and valdecoxib lowered intraocular pressure, suggesting that these agents may have utility in the treatment of this disorder. The crystal structure of celecoxib in complex with CA II reveals part of this inhibition to be mediated via binding of the sulfonamide group to the catalytic zinc of CA II. To investigate the structural basis for cross-reactivity of these compounds between COX-2 and CA II, we compared the molecular recognition properties of both protein binding pockets in terms of local physicochemical similarities among binding site-exposed amino acids accommodating different portions of the drug molecules. Our approach Cavbase, implemented into Relibase, detects similarities between the sites, suggesting some potential to predict unexpected cross-reactivity of drugs among functionally unrelated target proteins. The observed cross-reactivity with CAs may also contribute to differences in the pharmacological profiles, in particular with respect to glaucoma and anticancer therapy and may suggest new opportunities of these COX-2 selective NSAIDs.},

abstract = {Based on molecular information theory, 10 T7-like promoter models were built for the T7 group of phages and used to scan their host genomes and closely related genomes. 38 genomes were scanned and 12 clusters of tandem promoters were identified in nine enteropathogens. Comparative analysis of these tandem promoter-bearing regions reveals that they are similar to each other, forming prophage-like islands of 4-13 kb. Each island appears to contain two or three tandem T7-like promoters within a stretch of 150-620 bases, but there are no corresponding RNA polymerase (RNAP) genes. The promoters would transcribe two to five putative phage-related proteins, but none of these resemble known phage structural proteins. An integrase belonging to the Int family of site-specific recombinases is encoded upstream of the tandem promoters. A direct repeat of 17-24 bases was found on the ends of all 12 islands. Comparative analysis of the islands shows that these islands appear to have recombined with each other. These results suggest that the islands could encode a group of satellite phages. Activation and function of the islands may depend on transcription by a T7-like RNAP after infection by a T7-like phage or foreign DNA that encodes a T7-like RNAP.},

abstract = {Recently, we developed a simple isothermal nucleic acid amplification reaction, primer generation-rolling circle amplification (PG-RCA), to detect specific DNA sequences with great sensitivity and large dynamic range. In this paper, we combined PG-RCA with a three-way junction (3WJ) formation, and detected specific RNA molecules with high sensitivity and specificity in a one-step and isothermal reaction format. In the presence of target RNA, 3WJ probes (primer and template) are designed to form a 3WJ structure, from which multiple signal primers for the following PG-RCA can be generated by repeating primer extension, nicking and signal primer dissociation. Although this signal primer generation is a linear amplification process, the PG-RCA exponentially can amplify these signal primers and thus even a very small amount of RNA specimen can be detected. After optimizing the structures of 3WJ probes, the detection limit of this assay was 15.9 zmol (9.55 × 10(3) molecules) of synthetic RNA or 143 zmol (8.6 × 10(4) molecules) of in vitro transcribed human CD4 mRNA. Further, the applicability of this assay to detect CD4 mRNA in a human mRNA sample was demonstrated.},

Here, we show that the relBE genes of Escherichia coli K-12 have all the basic features previously connected with toxin-antitoxin systems: (i) relE encodes a cytotoxin lethal or inhibitory to host cells; (ii) relB encodes an antitoxin that prevents the lethal action of the relE-encoded toxin; (iii) the relBE genes stabilize a mini-R1 test plasmid; and (iv) the RelB antitoxin autoregulates the relBEF operon at the level of transcription. Using database searching, we found relBE homologues on the chromosomes of E. coli K-12, Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae. A fifth relBE homologue was identified on the enterotoxin encoding E. coli plasmid P307. Indirect evidence suggests that the toxicity of RelE may be related to the inhibition of protein synthesis. Based on these observations, we propose a model that explains the delayed relaxed phenotype associated with mutations in relB.},

Greengenes is a dedicated full-length 16S rRNA gene database that provides users with a curated taxonomy based on de novo tree inference. We developed a 'taxonomy to tree' approach for transferring group names from an existing taxonomy to a tree topology, and used it to apply the Greengenes, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and cyanoDB (Cyanobacteria only) taxonomies to a de novo tree comprising 408 315 sequences. We also incorporated explicit rank information provided by the NCBI taxonomy to group names (by prefixing rank designations) for better user orientation and classification consistency. The resulting merged taxonomy improved the classification of 75\% of the sequences by one or more ranks relative to the original NCBI taxonomy with the most pronounced improvements occurring in under-classified environmental sequences. We also assessed candidate phyla (divisions) currently defined by NCBI and present recommendations for consolidation of 34 redundantly named groups. All intermediate results from the pipeline, which includes tree inference, jackknifing and transfer of a donor taxonomy to a recipient tree (tax2tree) are available for download. The improved Greengenes taxonomy should provide important infrastructure for a wide range of megasequencing projects studying ecosystems on scales ranging from our own bodies (the Human Microbiome Project) to the entire planet (the Earth Microbiome Project). The implementation of the software can be obtained from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tax2tree/.},

Here, we present high-resolution crystal structures of the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome in complex with each of these stationary-phase factors. The binding site of RMF overlaps with that of the messenger RNA (mRNA) Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which prevents the interaction between the mRNA and the 16S ribosomal RNA. The nearly identical binding sites of HPF and YfiA overlap with those of the mRNA, transfer RNA, and initiation factors, which prevents translation initiation. The binding of RMF and HPF, but not YfiA, to the ribosome induces a conformational change of the 30S head domain that promotes 100S dimer formation.},

@article{Bader2001,
abstract = {Hannenhalli and Pevzner gave the first polynomial-time algorithm for computing the inversion distance between two signed permutations, as part of the larger task of determining the shortest sequence of inversions needed to transform one permutation into the other. Their algorithm (restricted to distance calculation) proceeds in two stages: in the first stage, the overlap graph induced by the permutation is decomposed into connected components; then, in the second stage, certain graph structures (hurdles and others) are identified. Berman and Hannenhalli avoided the explicit computation of the overlap graph and gave an O(nalpha(n)) algorithm, based on a Union-Find structure, to find its connected components, where alpha is the inverse Ackerman function. Since for all practical purposes alpha(n) is a constant no larger than four, this algorithm has been the fastest practical algorithm to date. In this paper, we present a new linear-time algorithm for computing the connected components, which is more efficient than that of Berman and Hannenhalli in both theory and practice. Our algorithm uses only a stack and is very easy to implement. We give the results of computational experiments over a large range of permutation pairs produced through simulated evolution; our experiments show a speed-up by a factor of 2 to 5 in the computation of the connected components and by a factor of 1.3 to 2 in the overall distance computation.},

abstract = {Members of the genus Pseudomonas inhabit a wide variety of environments, which is reflected in their versatile metabolic capacity and broad potential for adaptation to fluctuating environmental conditions. Here, we examine and compare the genomes of a range of Pseudomonas spp. encompassing plant, insect and human pathogens, and environmental saprophytes. In addition to a large number of allelic differences of common genes that confer regulatory and metabolic flexibility, genome analysis suggests that many other factors contribute to the diversity and adaptability of Pseudomonas spp. Horizontal gene transfer has impacted the capability of pathogenic Pseudomonas spp. in terms of disease severity (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and specificity (Pseudomonas syringae). Genome rearrangements likely contribute to adaptation, and a considerable complement of unique genes undoubtedly contributes to strain- and species-specific activities by as yet unknown mechanisms. Because of the lack of conserved phenotypic differences, the classification of the genus has long been contentious. DNA hybridization and genome-based analyses show close relationships among members of P. aeruginosa, but that isolates within the Pseudomonas fluorescens and P. syringae species are less closely related and may constitute different species. Collectively, genome sequences of Pseudomonas spp. have provided insights into pathogenesis and the genetic basis for diversity and adaptation.},

abstract = {The Plantae comprising red, green (including land plants), and glaucophyte algae are postulated to have a single common ancestor that is the founding lineage of photosynthetic eukaryotes. However, recent multiprotein phylogenies provide little or no support for this hypothesis. This may reflect limited complete genome data available for red algae, currently only the highly reduced genome of Cyanidioschyzon merolae, a reticulate gene ancestry, or variable gene divergence rates that mislead phylogenetic inference. Here, using novel genome data from the mesophilic Porphyridium cruentum and Calliarthron tuberculosum, we analyze 60,000 novel red algal genes to test the monophyly of red + green (RG) algae and their extent of gene sharing with other lineages. Using a gene-by-gene approach, we find an emerging signal of RG monophyly (supported by ∼50\% of the examined protein phylogenies) that increases with the number of distinct phyla and terminal taxa in the analysis. A total of 1,808 phylogenies show evidence of gene sharing between Plantae and other lineages. We demonstrate that a rich mesophilic red algal gene repertoire is crucial for testing controversial issues in eukaryote evolution and for understanding the complex patterns of gene inheritance in protists.},

abstract = {Biofilms are complex communities of microorganisms attached to surfaces or associated with interfaces. Despite the focus of modern microbiology research on pure culture, planktonic (free-swimming) bacteria, it is now widely recognized that most bacteria found in natural, clinical, and industrial settings persist in association with surfaces. Furthermore, these microbial communities are often composed of multiple species that interact with each other and their environment. The determination of biofilm architecture, particularly the spatial arrangement of microcolonies (clusters of cells) relative to one another, has profound implications for the function of these complex communities. Numerous new experimental approaches and methodologies have been developed in order to explore metabolic interactions, phylogenetic groupings, and competition among members of the biofilm. To complement this broad view of biofilm ecology, individual organisms have been studied using molecular genetics in order to identify the genes required for biofilm development and to dissect the regulatory pathways that control the plankton-to-biofilm transition. These molecular genetic studies have led to the emergence of the concept of biofilm formation as a novel system for the study of bacterial development. The recent explosion in the field of biofilm research has led to exciting progress in the development of new technologies for studying these communities, advanced our understanding of the ecological significance of surface-attached bacteria, and provided new insights into the molecular genetic basis of biofilm development.},

The A32-U38 pair, which is highly conserved in tRNA2(Ala) and sometimes observed in tRNA2(Pro), was recently found to decrease the affinity of tRNAs to the ribosomal A site relative to other 32-38 combinations. This suggests that the role of 32-38 pair is to tune the tRNA affinity in the A site to a uniform value. New experiments presented here show that the U32C mutation in tRNA1(Gly) increases its affinity to the cognate codon and to codons with third position mismatches in the A site. This suggests that one reason for uniform tRNA binding to evolve was to avoid incorrect codon recognition.},

By using carbon nanotube arrays that are dominated by a straight body segment but with curly entangled top, we have created gecko-foot-mimetic dry adhesives that show macroscopic adhesive forces of approximately 100 newtons per square centimeter, almost 10 times that of a gecko foot, and a much stronger shear adhesion force than the normal adhesion force, to ensure strong binding along the shear direction and easy lifting in the normal direction. This anisotropic force distribution is due to the shear-induced alignments of the curly segments of the nanotubes. The mimetic adhesives can be alternatively binding-on and lifting-off over various substrates for simulating the walking of a living gecko.},

abstract = {Two-thirds of Earth's surface is covered by oceans, yet the study of this massive integrated living system is still in its infancy. Various environmental variables, such as high salinity, low and changeable nutrient availability and depth-correlated gradients of light, temperature, nutrients and pressure shape the diversity, physiology and ecology of marine species. As oceans present an average depth of 3800 m, deep-sea ecosystems represent the most common marine ecological niche. One of the key environment variables that influences the life and evolution of deep-sea organisms is high pressure. This extreme widespread condition requires specific adaptations, the nature of which remains largely unknown. Recent advances in genomic approaches, such as in sequencing technologies and global expression profiling, are rapidly increasing the data available to understand microbial evolution, biochemistry, physiology and diversity. This review summarises the analysis of the results published so far about microbial high pressure adaptation from a genomic point of view. Understanding high pressure adaptation mechanisms is not just a scientific exercise but has important biotechnological implications. For example, hydrostatic pressure is a reality for food science and technology, both for food preparation and preservation. An understanding of the effects of pressure on biomolecules will expand its use in the medical, industrial and biotechnological fields.},

Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA data for 30 strains belonging to the order Methanobacteriales strongly suggested that mesophilic and thermophilic Methanobacterium isolates are distantly related and should be assigned to separate genera. For the thermophilic strains the genus Methanothermobacter was initially proposed by Boone, Whitman and Rouvi\`{e}re. Furthermore, the results support a reclassification of 15 isolates in three species within the proposed genus: (i) Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus comb. nov., containing eight isolates, six of which are able to utilize formate (type strain deltaHT); (ii) Methanothermobacter wolfeii comb. nov., containing four formate-utilizing isolates (type strain DSM 2970T); (iii) Methanothermobacter marburgensis sp. nov., containing three obligately autotrophic isolates (type strain MarburgT).

Both the kinetics and thermodynamics were obtained in individual ITC experiments, and analysis of the kinetic data over a range of temperatures provided Arrhenius activation energies ($\Delta$H(‡)) and Eyring transition state entropies ($\Delta$S(‡)). The resulting rich dataset reveals strongly contrasting kinetic and thermodynamic profiles for this RNA folding system when stabilized by potassium versus magnesium. In potassium, association is highly exothermic ($\Delta$H(25°C) = -41.6 ± 1.2 kcal/mol in 150 mM KCl) and the transition state is enthalpically barrierless ($\Delta$H(‡) = -0.6 ± 0.5). These parameters are significantly positively shifted in magnesium ($\Delta$H(25°C) = -20.5 ± 2.1 kcal/mol, $\Delta$H(‡) = 7.3 ± 2.2 kcal/mol in 0.5 mM MgCl(2)). Mixed salt solutions approximating physiological conditions exhibit an intermediate thermodynamic character.

abstract = {The prospect of phasing diffraction data sets ;de novo' for proteins with previously unseen folds is appealing but largely untested. In a first systematic exploration of phasing with Rosetta de novo models, it is shown that all-atom refinement of coarse-grained models significantly improves both the model quality and performance in molecular replacement with the Phaser software. 15 new cases of diffraction data sets that are unambiguously phased with de novo models are presented. These diffraction data sets represent nine space groups and span a large range of solvent contents (33-79\%) and asymmetric unit copy numbers (1-4). No correlation is observed between the ease of phasing and the solvent content or asymmetric unit copy number. Instead, a weak correlation is found with the length of the modeled protein: larger proteins required somewhat less accurate models to give successful molecular replacement. Overall, the results of this survey suggest that de novo models can phase diffraction data for approximately one sixth of proteins with sizes of 100 residues or less. However, for many of these cases, ;de novo phasing with de novo models' requires significant investment of computational power, much greater than 10(3) CPU days per target. Improvements in conformational search methods will be necessary if molecular replacement with de novo models is to become a practical tool for targets without homology to previously solved protein structures.},

abstract = {On learning that nucleic acid hybridization had been achieved in a test tube, Huxley hailed the discovery of "molecular sex." The description was apt, since sex involves recombination, which requires hybridization that, in turn, depends on a successful homology search. Conversely, when the homology search fails, recombination fails. In yeast, this failure has been attributed to "simple sequence divergence." But sequence divergence does not impair nucleic acid hybridization simply. Most natural single-stranded nucleic acids are predisposed to adopt higher-order structures containing stem-loops. Tomizawa showed that the rate-limiting step in the hybridization of single-stranded sequences is an initial "kissing" exploration between complementary loops, which must first be appropriately extruded and aligned. Successful duplex formation requires successful synchronization of matching higher-ordered structures, which depends, not so much on the degree of similarity between their base sequences as on the closeness of their base compositions (GC\%). In these terms, we can understand how the anti-recombinational effect of GC\% differences supports the duplication both of genes within a genome and of genomes within a genus (speciation).},

abstract = {Substrate cleavage by the Neurospora Varkud satellite (VS) ribozyme involves a structural change in the stem-loop I substrate from an inactive to an active conformation. We have determined the NMR solution structure of a mutant stem-loop I that mimics the active conformation of the cleavage site internal loop. This structure shares many similarities, but also significant differences, with the previously determined structures of the inactive internal loop. The active internal loop displays different base-pairing interactions and forms a novel RNA fold composed exclusively of sheared G-A base pairs. From chemical-shift mapping we identified two Mg2+ binding sites in the active internal loop. One of the Mg2+ binding sites forms in the active but not the inactive conformation of the internal loop and is likely important for catalysis. Using the structure comparison program mc-search, we identified the active internal loop fold in other RNA structures. In Thermus thermophilus 16S rRNA, this RNA fold is directly involved in a long-range tertiary interaction. An analogous tertiary interaction may form between the active internal loop of the substrate and the catalytic domain of the VS ribozyme. The combination of NMR and bioinformatic approaches presented here has identified a novel RNA fold and provides insights into the structural basis of catalytic function in the Neurospora VS ribozyme.},

abstract = {Microorganisms are widely used to generate valuable products, and their efficiency is a major industrial focus. Bioreactors are typically composed of billions of cells, and available measurements only reflect the overall performance of the population. However, cells do not equally contribute, and process optimization would therefore benefit from monitoring this intrapopulation diversity. Such monitoring has so far remained difficult because of the inability to probe concentration changes at the single-cell level. Here, we unlock this limitation by taking advantage of the osmotically driven water flux between a droplet containing a living cell toward surrounding empty droplets, within a concentrated inverse emulsion. With proper formulation, excreted products are far more soluble within the continuous hydrophobic phase compared to initial nutrients (carbohydrates and salts). Fast diffusion of products induces an osmotic mismatch, which further relaxes due to slower diffusion of water through hydrophobic interfaces. By measuring droplet volume variations, we can deduce the metabolic activity down to isolated single cells. As a proof of concept, we present the first direct measurement of the maintenance energy of individual yeast cells. This method does not require any added probes and can in principle apply to any osmotically sensitive bioactivity, opening new routes for screening, and sorting large libraries of microorganisms and biomolecules.},

Cells were motile, straight rods, 2.5 mum long and 0.2 mum wide, and formed orange colonies on marine agar medium. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain 13IX/A01/164(T) was 42 mol\%. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence placed the strain in the phylum Bacteroidetes within the family Crenotrichaceae. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison and physiological and biochemical characteristics, this isolate represents a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Balneola vulgaris gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed.

abstract = {Fis is a small basic DNA-binding protein from Escherichia coli that was identified because of its role in site-specific DNA recombination reactions. Recent evidence indicates that Fis also participates in essential cell processes such as rRNA and tRNA transcription and chromosomal DNA replication. In this report, we show that Fis levels vary dramatically during the course of cell growth and in response to changing environmental conditions. When stationary-phase cells are subcultured into a rich medium, Fis levels increase from less than 100 to over 50,000 copies per cell prior to the first cell division. As cells enter exponential growth, nascent synthesis is largely shut off, and intracellular Fis levels decrease as a function of cell division. Fis synthesis also transiently increases when exponentially growing cells are shifted to a richer medium. The magnitude of the peak of Fis synthesis appears to reflect the extent of the nutritional upshift. fis mRNA levels closely resemble the protein expression pattern, suggesting that regulation occurs largely at the transcriptional level. Two RNA polymerase-binding sites and at least six high-affinity Fis-binding sites are present in the fis promoter region. We show that expression of the fis operon is negatively regulated by Fis in vivo and that purified Fis can prevent stable complex formation by RNA polymerase at the fis promoter in vitro. However, autoregulation only partially accounts for the expression pattern of Fis. We suggest that the fluctuations in Fis levels may serve as an early signal of a nutritional upshift and may be important in the physiological roles Fis plays in the cell.},

abstract = {The dynamic mechanisms by which RNAs acquire biologically functional structures are of increasing importance to the rapidly expanding fields of RNA therapeutics and biotechnology. Large energy barriers separating misfolded and functional states arising from alternate base pairing are a well-appreciated characteristic of RNA. In contrast, it is typically assumed that functionally folded RNA occupies a single native basin of attraction that is free of deeply dividing energy barriers (ergodic hypothesis). This assumption is widely used as an implicit basis to interpret experimental ensemble-averaged data. Here, we develop an experimental approach to isolate persistent sub-populations of a small RNA enzyme and show by single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET), biochemical probing and high-resolution mass spectrometry that commitment to one of several catalytically active folds occurs unexpectedly high on the RNA folding energy landscape, resulting in partially irreversible folding. Our experiments reveal the retention of molecular heterogeneity following the complete loss of all native secondary and tertiary structure. Our results demonstrate a surprising longevity of molecular heterogeneity and advance our current understanding beyond that of non-functional misfolds of RNA kinetically trapped on a rugged folding-free energy landscape.},

abstract = {Soil grains harbor an astonishing diversity of Streptomyces strains producing diverse secondary metabolites. However, it is not understood how this genotypic and chemical diversity is ecologically maintained. While secondary metabolites are known to mediate signaling and warfare among strains, no systematic measurement of the resulting interaction networks has been available. We developed a high-throughput platform to measure all pairwise interactions among 64 Streptomyces strains isolated from several individual grains of soil. We acquired more than 10,000 time-lapse movies of colony development of each isolate on media containing compounds produced by each of the other isolates. We observed a rich set of such sender-receiver interactions, including inhibition and promotion of growth and aerial mycelium formation. The probability that two random isolates interact is balanced; it is neither close to zero nor one. The interactions are not random: the distribution of the number of interactions per sender is bimodal and there is enrichment for reciprocity-if strain A inhibits or promotes B, it is likely that B also inhibits or promotes A. Such reciprocity is further enriched in strains derived from the same soil grain, suggesting that it may be a property of coexisting communities. Interactions appear to evolve rapidly: isolates with identical 16S rRNA sequences can have very different interaction patterns. A simple eco-evolutionary model of bacteria interacting through antibiotic production shows how fast evolution of production and resistance can lead to the observed statistical properties of the network. In the model, communities are evolutionarily unstable-they are constantly being invaded by strains with new sets of interactions. This combination of experimental and theoretical observations suggests that diverse Streptomyces communities do not represent a stable ecological state but an intrinsically dynamic eco-evolutionary phenomenon.},

abstract = {The ribosomal stalk in bacteria is composed of four or six copies of L12 proteins arranged in dimers that bind to the adjacent sites on protein L10, spanning 10 amino acids each from the L10 C-terminus. To study why multiple L12 dimers are required on the ribosome, we created a chromosomally engineered Escherichia coli strain, JE105, in which the peripheral L12 dimer binding site was deleted. Thus JE105 harbors ribosomes with only a single L12 dimer. Compared to MG1655, the parental strain with two L12 dimers, JE105 showed significant growth defect suggesting suboptimal function of the ribosomes with one L12 dimer. When tested in a cell-free reconstituted transcription-translation assay the synthesis of a full-length protein, firefly luciferase, was notably slower with JE105 70S ribosomes and 50S subunits. Further, in vitro analysis by fast kinetics revealed that single L12 dimer ribosomes from JE105 are defective in two major steps of translation, namely initiation and elongation involving translational GTPases IF2 and EF-G. Varying number of L12 dimers on the ribosome can be a mechanism in bacteria for modulating the rate of translation in response to growth condition.},

abstract = {Although natural selection appears to favor the elimination of gene redundancy in prokaryotes, multiple copies of each rRNA-encoding gene are common on bacterial chromosomes. Despite this conspicuous deviation from single-copy genes, no phenotype has been consistently associated with rRNA gene copy number. We found that the number of rRNA genes correlates with the rate at which phylogenetically diverse bacteria respond to resource availability. Soil bacteria that formed colonies rapidly upon exposure to a nutritionally complex medium contained an average of 5.5 copies of the small subunit rRNA gene, whereas bacteria that responded slowly contained an average of 1.4 copies. In soil microcosms pulsed with the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), indigenous populations of 2,4-D-degrading bacteria with multiple rRNA genes ( = 5.4) became dominant, whereas populations with fewer rRNA genes ( = 2.7) were favored in unamended controls. These findings demonstrate phenotypic effects associated with rRNA gene copy number that are indicative of ecological strategies influencing the structure of natural microbial communities.},

This study evaluated E. coli O157:H7 attachment, survival and growth on food-contact surfaces under simulated beef processing conditions. Stainless steel and high-density polyethylene surfaces (2×5cm) were individually suspended into each of three substrates inoculated (6log CFU/ml or g) with E. coli O157:H7 (rifampicin-resistant, six-strain composite) and then incubated (168h) statically at 4 or 15°C. The three tested soiling substrates included sterile tryptic soy broth (TSB), unsterilized beef fat-lean tissue (1:1 [wt/wt]) homogenate (10\% [wt/wt] with sterile distilled water) and unsterilized ground beef. Initial adherence/attachment of E. coli O157:H7 (0.9 to 2.9log CFU/cm(2)) on stainless steel and high-density polyethylene was not affected by the type of food-contact surface but was greater (p<0.05) through ground beef. Adherent and suspended E. coli O157:H7 counts increased during storage at 15°C (168h) by 2.2 to 5.4log CFU/cm(2) and 1.0 to 2.8log CFU/ml or g, respectively. At 4°C (168h), although pathogen levels decreased slightly in the substrates, numbers of adherent cells remained constant on coupons in ground beef (2.4 to 2.5log CFU/cm(2)) and increased on coupons in TSB and fat-lean tissue homogenate by 0.9 to 1.0and 1.7 to 2.0log CFU/cm(2), respectively, suggesting further cell attachment. The results of this study indicate that E. coli O157:H7 attachment to beef-contact surfaces was influenced by the type of soiling substrate and temperature. Notably, attachment occurred not only at a temperature representative of beef fabrication areas during non-production hours (15°C), but also during cold storage (4°C) temperatures, thus, rendering the design of more effective sanitation programs necessary.},

In this study we used a proteomics and bioinformatics approach to decipher the proteome changes related to sustained growth at low temperatures to increase our understanding of cold adaptation mechanisms in A. ferrooxidans strains. Changes in protein abundance in response to low temperatures (5 and 15°C) were monitored and protein analyses of a psychrotrophic strain (D6) versus a mesophilic strain (F1) showed that both strains increased levels of 11 stress-related and metabolic proteins including survival protein SurA, trigger factor Tig, and AhpC-Tsa antioxidant proteins. However, a unique set of changes in the proteome of psychrotrophic strain D6 were observed. In particular, the importance of protein fate, membrane transport and structure for psychrotrophic growth were evident with increases in numerous chaperone and transport proteins including GroEL, SecB, ABC transporters and a capsule polysaccharide export protein. We also observed that low temperature iron oxidation coincides with a relative increase in the key iron metabolism protein rusticyanin, which was more highly expressed in strain D6 than in strain F1 at colder growth temperatures. We demonstrate that the psychrotrophic strain uses a global stress response and cold-active metabolism which permit growth of A. ferrooxidans in the extreme AMD environment in colder climates.},

Dyneins are members of the AAA+ superfamily of ring-shaped enzymes, but how they harness this architecture to produce movement is poorly understood. Here, we have used cryo-EM to determine 3D maps of native flagellar dynein-c and a cytoplasmic dynein motor domain in different nucleotide states. The structures show key sites of conformational change within the AAA+ ring and a large rearrangement of the "linker" domain, involving a hinge near its middle. Analysis of a mutant in which the linker "undocks" from the ring indicates that linker remodeling requires energy that is supplied by interactions with the AAA+ modules. Fitting the dynein-c structures into flagellar tomograms suggests how this mechanism could drive sliding between microtubules, and also has implications for cytoplasmic cargo transport.},

abstract = {Mutations in the erythroid-specific aminolevulinic acid synthase gene (ALAS2) cause X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) by reducing mitochondrial enzymatic activity. Surprisingly, a patient with the classic XLSA phenotype had a novel exon 11 mutation encoding a recombinant enzyme (p.Met567Val) with normal activity, kinetics, and stability. Similarly, both an expressed adjacent XLSA mutation, p.Ser568Gly, and a mutation (p.Phe557Ter) lacking the 31 carboxyl-terminal residues also had normal or enhanced activity, kinetics, and stability. Because ALAS2 binds to the $\beta$ subunit of succinyl-CoA synthetase (SUCLA2), the mutant proteins were tested for their ability to bind to this protein. Wild type ALAS2 bound strongly to a SUCLA2 affinity column, but the adjacent XLSA mutant enzymes and the truncated mutant did not bind. In contrast, vitamin B6-responsive XLSA mutations p.Arg452Cys and p.Arg452His, with normal in vitro enzyme activity and stability, did not interfere with binding to SUCLA2 but instead had loss of positive cooperativity for succinyl-CoA binding, an increased K(m) for succinyl-CoA, and reduced vitamin B6 affinity.

abstract = {Legionella pneumophila first commanded attention in 1976, when investigators from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified it as the culprit in a massive outbreak of pneumonia that struck individuals attending an American Legion convention (). It is now clear that this gram-negative bacterium flourishes naturally in fresh water as a parasite of amoebae, but it can also replicate within alveolar macrophages. L. pneumophila pathogenesis is discussed using the following model as a framework. When ingested by phagocytes, stationary-phase L. pneumophila bacteria establish phagosomes which are completely isolated from the endosomal pathway but are surrounded by endoplasmic reticulum. Within this protected vacuole, L. pneumophila converts to a replicative form that is acid tolerant but no longer expresses several virulence traits, including factors that block membrane fusion. As a consequence, the pathogen vacuoles merge with lysosomes, which provide a nutrient-rich replication niche. Once the amino acid supply is depleted, progeny accumulate the second messenger guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp), which coordinates entry into the stationary phase with expression of traits that promote transmission to a new phagocyte. A number of factors contribute to L. pneumophila virulence, including type II and type IV secretion systems, a pore-forming toxin, type IV pili, flagella, and numerous other factors currently under investigation. Because of its resemblance to certain aspects of Mycobacterium, Toxoplasma, Leishmania, and Coxiella pathogenesis, a detailed description of the mechanism used by L. pneumophila to manipulate and exploit phagocyte membrane traffic may suggest novel strategies for treating a variety of infectious diseases. Knowledge of L. pneumophila ecology may also inform efforts to combat the emergence of new opportunistic macrophage pathogens.},

abstract = {While functional roles of several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been determined, the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report the first experimentally derived secondary structure of a human lncRNA, the steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA), 0.87 kB in size. The SRA RNA is a non-coding RNA that coactivates several human sex hormone receptors and is strongly associated with breast cancer. Coding isoforms of SRA are also expressed to produce proteins, making the SRA gene a unique bifunctional system. Our experimental findings (SHAPE, in-line, DMS and RNase V1 probing) reveal that this lncRNA has a complex structural organization, consisting of four domains, with a variety of secondary structure elements. We examine the coevolution of the SRA gene at the RNA structure and protein structure levels using comparative sequence analysis across vertebrates. Rapid evolutionary stabilization of RNA structure, combined with frame-disrupting mutations in conserved regions, suggests that evolutionary pressure preserves the RNA structural core rather than its translational product. We perform similar experiments on alternatively spliced SRA isoforms to assess their structural features.},

abstract = {Type III secreted effectors (T3SEs), such as Pseudomonas syringae HopZ1, are essential bacterial virulence proteins injected into the host cytosol to facilitate infection. However, few direct targets of T3SEs are known. Investigating the target(s) of HopZ1 in soybean, a natural P. syringae host, we find that HopZ1 physically interacts with the isoflavone biosynthesis enzyme, 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase (GmHID1). P. syringae infection induces gmhid1 expression and production of daidzein, a major soybean isoflavone. Silencing gmhid1 increases susceptibility to P. syringae infection, supporting a role for GmHID1 in innate immunity. P. syringae expressing active but not the catalytic mutant of HopZ1 inhibits daidzein induction and promotes bacterial multiplication in soybean. HopZ1-enhanced P. syringae multiplication is at least partially dependent on GmHID1. Thus, GmHID1 is a virulence target of HopZ1 to promote P. syringae infection of soybean. This work highlights the isoflavonoid biosynthesis pathway as an antibacterial defense mechanism and a direct T3SE target.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic trees of individual genes of prokaryotes (archaea and bacteria) generally have different topologies, largely owing to extensive horizontal gene transfer (HGT), suggesting that the Tree of Life (TOL) should be replaced by a "net of life" as the paradigm of prokaryote evolution. However, trees remain the natural representation of the histories of individual genes given the fundamentally bifurcating process of gene replication. Therefore, although no single tree can fully represent the evolution of prokaryote genomes, the complete picture of evolution will necessarily combine trees and nets. A quantitative measure of the signals of tree and net evolution is derived from an analysis of all quartets of species in all trees of the "Forest of Life" (FOL), which consists of approximately 7,000 phylogenetic trees for prokaryote genes including approximately 100 nearly universal trees (NUTs). Although diverse routes of net-like evolution collectively dominate the FOL, the pattern of tree-like evolution that reflects the consistent topologies of the NUTs is the most prominent coherent trend. We show that the contributions of tree-like and net-like evolutionary processes substantially differ across bacterial and archaeal lineages and between functional classes of genes. Evolutionary simulations indicate that the central tree-like signal cannot be realistically explained by a self-reinforcing pattern of biased HGT.},

We investigated characteristics of 16S rRNA genes in Vibrio splendidus strain PB1-10, from the normal flora of Atlantic halibut. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene clones detected 35 variable positions in a total of 13 different gene copies. More than two-thirds of the substitutions occurred in regions corresponding to helix H6 and helix H17 of the 16S rRNA molecule. Possible recombination between these helixes in related bacteria (Vibrio, Photobacterium, Colwellia) from similar environments impacts 16S rRNA-based phylogeny of V. splendidus. We argue that these nonrandom modifications are maintained to provide a fine-tuning of the ribosome function to optimize translation machinery performance and ultimately bacterial niche fitness.},

A few years ago, controversy arose when it was shown that C5-deficient mice were more susceptible to experimental asthma compared with C5-sufficient mice. In a study by K\"{o}hl et al. in this issue of the JCI, it is shown in a series of truly “complementary” experiments that C5a receptor (C5aR) blockade promotes Th2 sensitization upon first exposure to inhaled allergen, whereas C5aR blockade during established inflammation suppresses the cardinal features of asthma (see the related article beginning on page 783). Blockade of C5aR alters the function of airway DCs, crucial for inducing and maintaining Th2 responses in the lung. Targeting C5aR as a treatment for established asthma could be beneficial, but might be accompanied by sensitization to novel antigens.},

Recent studies indicate that a fractal model of chromatin architecture is consistent with both the reaction-diffusion properties of chromatin interacting proteins and with structural data on chromatin interminglement. In this study, we provide a critical overview of the experimental evidence that support a fractal organization of chromatin. On this basis, we discuss the functional implications of a fractal chromatin model for biological processes and propose future experiments to probe chromatin organization further that should allow to strongly support or invalidate the fractal hypothesis.},

Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that these organisms represent four novel species of the genus Deinococcus; levels of sequence similarity to the type strains of recognized Deinococcus species were in the range 89.3-94.7 \%. Strains PO-04-20-132T, PO-04-20-144, PO-04-19-125T, ME-04-01-32T and ME-04-04-52T grew aerobically, with optimum growth at 10 degrees C and at pH 6-9. The major respiratory menaquinone was MK-8. The fatty acid profiles of strains PO-04-20-132T, PO-04-20-144, PO-04-19-125T and ME-04-01-32T were dominated by 16 : 1omega7c, 17 : 0 iso and 15 : 1omega6c, whereas 16 : 1omega7c, 17 : 0 cyclo and 16 : 0 predominated in strain ME-04-04-52T. The DNA G+C contents of strains PO-04-20-132T, PO-04-19-125T, ME-04-01-32T and ME-04-04-52T were 63.2, 63.1, 65.9 and 62.6 mol\%, respectively. Strains PO-04-20-132T, PO-04-19-125T, ME-04-01-32T and ME-04-04-52T had gamma radiation D10 (dose required to reduce the bacterial population by 10-fold) values of < or =4 kGy. These four strains showed sensitivity to UV radiation and extended desiccation as compared with Deinococcus radiodurans. On the basis of the phylogenetic analyses, and chemotaxonomic and phenotypic data, it is proposed that strains PO-04-20-132T (=LMG 24019T=NRRL B-41950T; Deinococcus radiomollis sp. nov.), PO-04-19-125T (=LMG 24282T=NRRL B-41949T; Deinococcus claudionis sp. nov.), ME-04-01-32T (=LMG 24022T=NRRL B-41947T; Deinococcus altitudinis sp. nov.) and ME-04-04-52T (=LMG 24283T=NRRL B-41948T; Deinococcus alpinitundrae sp. nov.) represent the type strains of four novel species of the genus Deinococcus.},

abstract = {Cryopreservation of microorganisms in ancient glacial ice is possible if lethal levels of macromolecular damage are not incurred and cellular integrity is not compromised via intracellular ice formation or recrystallization. Previously, a bacterium (isolate 3519-10) recovered from a depth of 3,519 m below the surface in the Vostok ice core was shown to secrete an ice-binding protein (IBP) that inhibits the recrystallization of ice. To explore the advantage that IBPs confer to ice-entrapped cells, experiments were designed to examine the expression of 3519-10's IBP gene and protein at different temperatures, assess the effect of the IBP on bacterial viability in ice, and determine how the IBP influences the physical structure of the ice. Total RNA isolated from cultures grown between 4 and 25°C and analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR indicated constitutive expression of the IBP gene. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of 3519-10's extracellular proteins revealed a polypeptide of the predicted size of the 54-kDa IBP at all temperatures tested. In the presence of 100 $\mu$g mL(-1) of extracellular protein from 3519-10, the survival of Escherichia coli was increased by greater than 100-fold after 5 freeze-thaw cycles. Microscopic analysis of ice formed in the presence of the IBP indicated that per square millimeter field of view, there were \~{}5 times as many crystals as in ice formed in the presence of washed 3519-10 cells and non-IBP producing bacteria, and \~{}10 times as many crystals as in filtered deionized water. Presumably, the effect that the IBP has on bacterial viability and ice crystal structure is due to its activity as an inhibitor of ice recrystallization. A myriad of molecular adaptations are likely to play a role in bacterial persistence under frozen conditions, but the ability of 3519-10's IBP to control ice crystal structure, and thus the liquid vein network within the ice, may provide one explanation for its successful survival deep within the Antarctic ice sheet for thousands of years.},

Here we describe a robust assay in Escherichia coli to explore the hitherto least-studied process, adaptation. We identify essential genes and DNA elements in the leader sequence and in the array which are essential for the adaptation step. We also provide mechanistic insights on the insertion of the repeat-spacer unit by showing that the first repeat serves as the template for the newly inserted repeat. Taken together, our results elucidate fundamental steps in the adaptation process of the CRISPR/Cas system.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, the analysis of alternative splicing using bioinformatics has emerged as an important new field, and has significantly changed our view of genome function. One exciting front has been the analysis of microarray data to measure alternative splicing genome-wide. Pioneering studies of both human and mouse data have produced algorithms for discerning evidence of alternative splicing and clustering genes and samples by their alternative splicing patterns. Moreover, these data indicate the presence of alternative splice forms in up to 80 per cent of human genes. Comparative genomics studies in both mammals and insects have demonstrated that alternative splicing can in some cases be predicted directly from comparisons of genome sequences, based on heightened sequence conservation and exon length. Such studies have also provided new insights into the connection between alternative splicing and a variety of evolutionary processes such as Alu-based exonisation, exon creation and loss. A number of groups have used a combination of bioinformatics, comparative genomics and experimental validation to identify new motifs for splice regulatory factors, analyse the balance of factors that regulate alternative splicing, and propose a new mechanism for regulation based on the interaction of alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay. Bioinformatics studies of the functional impact of alternative splicing have revealed a wide range of regulatory mechanisms, from NAGNAG sites that add a single amino acid; to short peptide segments that can play surprisingly complex roles in switching protein conformation and function (as in the Piccolo C2A domain); to events that entirely remove a specific protein interaction domain or membrane anchoring domain. Common to many bioinformatics studies is a new emphasis on graph representations of alternative splicing structures, which have many advantages for analysis.},

abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of many cell processes often deregulated in cancer, including apoptosis. Indeed, it is becoming clear that many miRNAs are anti-apoptotic and mediate this effect by targeting pro-apoptotic mRNAs or positive regulators of pro-apoptotic mRNAs. Conversely, many pro-apoptotic miRNAs target anti-apoptotic mRNAs or their positive regulators. We have reviewed the current knowledge in this area including evidence of miRNA involvement in cancer drug resistance.},

abstract = {Nitrospira are barely studied and mostly uncultured nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, which are, according to molecular data, among the most diverse and widespread nitrifiers in natural ecosystems and biological wastewater treatment. Here, environmental genomics was used to reconstruct the complete genome of "Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii" from an activated sludge enrichment culture. On the basis of this first-deciphered Nitrospira genome and of experimental data, we show that Ca. N. defluvii differs dramatically from other known nitrite oxidizers in the key enzyme nitrite oxidoreductase (NXR), in the composition of the respiratory chain, and in the pathway used for autotrophic carbon fixation, suggesting multiple independent evolution of chemolithoautotrophic nitrite oxidation. Adaptations of Ca. N. defluvii to substrate-limited conditions include an unusual periplasmic NXR, which is constitutively expressed, and pathways for the transport, oxidation, and assimilation of simple organic compounds that allow a mixotrophic lifestyle. The reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle as the pathway for CO2 fixation and the lack of most classical defense mechanisms against oxidative stress suggest that Nitrospira evolved from microaerophilic or even anaerobic ancestors. Unexpectedly, comparative genomic analyses indicate functionally significant lateral gene-transfer events between the genus Nitrospira and anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing planctomycetes, which share highly similar forms of NXR and other proteins reflecting that two key processes of the nitrogen cycle are evolutionarily connected.},

@article{Pemberton2000,
abstract = {RNA polymerase forms a highly stable preinitiation complex at many prokaryotic promoters in the absence of ribonucleotides. These are often characterised by the longevity of the DNA strand-separated (open) complex in the presence of heparin. In contrast, such complexes are notoriously unstable at the promoters for rRNA and tRNA under similar conditions. The high G+C content within the DNA-melting region of these promoters has been implicated in this seemingly anomalous behaviour. Here, we used rapid-pulse UV laser photo-footprinting to monitor the transient structural intermediates formed at the Escherichia coli tyrT promoter. Promoter derivatives with A+T for G/C base substitutions within the G+C-rich discriminator region (-7 to -1) augmented the stability of complexes on both linear fragments and supercoiled plasmid DNA. Analysis of the lifetime of the preinitiation complexes as a function of the discriminator sequence reveals a direct relationship between the A+T content of the DNA-melting region and the stability of the ensuing complex. Our results are consistent with the premise that a G/C block to DNA-untwisting and/or DNA-melting operates to prevent the formation of the stable isomers that are implicated in most other transcription initiation pathways.},

@article{Jonikas2009,
abstract = {Understanding the function of complex RNA molecules depends critically on understanding their structure. However, creating three-dimensional (3D) structural models of RNA remains a significant challenge. We present a protocol (the nucleic acid simulation tool [NAST]) for RNA modeling that uses an RNA-specific knowledge-based potential in a coarse-grained molecular dynamics engine to generate plausible 3D structures. We demonstrate NAST's capabilities by using only secondary structure and tertiary contact predictions to generate, cluster, and rank structures. Representative structures in the best ranking clusters averaged 8.0 +/- 0.3 A and 16.3 +/- 1.0 A RMSD for the yeast phenylalanine tRNA and the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron, respectively. The coarse-grained resolution allows us to model large molecules such as the 158-residue P4-P6 or the 388-residue T. thermophila group I intron. One advantage of NAST is the ability to rank clusters of structurally similar decoys based on their compatibility with experimental data. We successfully used ideal small-angle X-ray scattering data and both ideal and experimental solvent accessibility data to select the best cluster of structures for both tRNA and P4-P6. Finally, we used NAST to build in missing loops in the crystal structures of the Azoarcus and Twort ribozymes, and to incorporate crystallographic data into the Michel-Westhof model of the T. thermophila group I intron, creating an integrated model of the entire molecule. Our software package is freely available at https://simtk.org/home/nast.},

@article{Stemmer1994,
abstract = {Computer simulations of the evolution of linear sequences have demonstrated the importance of recombination of blocks of sequence rather than point mutagenesis alone. Repeated cycles of point mutagenesis, recombination, and selection should allow in vitro molecular evolution of complex sequences, such as proteins. A method for the reassembly of genes from their random DNA fragments, resulting in in vitro recombination is reported. A 1-kb gene, after DNase I digestion and purification of 10- to 50-bp random fragments, was reassembled to its original size and function. Similarly, a 2.7-kb plasmid could be efficiently reassembled. Complete recombination was obtained between two markers separated by 75 bp; each marker was located on a separate gene. Oligonucleotides with 3' and 5' ends that are homologous to the gene can be added to the fragment mixture and incorporated into the reassembled gene. Thus, mixtures of synthetic oligonucleotides and PCR fragments can be mixed into a gene at defined positions based on homology. As an example, a library of chimeras of the human and murine genes for interleukin 1 beta has been prepared. Shuffling can also be used for the in vitro equivalent of some standard genetic manipulations, such as a backcross with parental DNA. The advantages of recombination over existing mutagenesis methods are likely to increase with the numbers of cycles of molecular evolution.},

abstract = {We describe a viable microbial community in a subglacial lake within the Gr\'{\i}msv\"{o}tn volcanic caldera, Iceland. We used a hot water drill to penetrate the 300-m ice shelf and retrieved lake water and volcanic tephra sediments. We also acquired samples of borehole water before and after penetration to the lake, overlying glacial ice and snow, and water from a nearby subaerial geothermal lake for comparative analyses. Lake water is at the freezing point and fresh (total dissolved solids = 260 mg L(-1)). Detectable numbers of cells were found in samples of the lake water column and tephra sediments: 2 x 10(4) ml(-1) and 4 x 10(7) g(-1), respectively. Plate counts document abundant cold-adapted cultivable organisms in the lake water, but not in the borehole (before penetration) or glacial ice. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from genomic DNA extracted from Gr\'{\i}msv\"{o}tn samples indicates that the lake community is distinct from the assemblages of organisms in borehole water (before penetration) and the overlying ice and snow. Sequencing of selected DGGE bands revealed that many sequences are highly similar to known psychrophilic organisms or cloned DNA from other cold environments. Significant uptake of 14C-labeled bicarbonate occurred in dark, low-temperature incubations of lake water samples, indicating the presence of autotrophs. Acetylene reduction assays under similar incubation conditions showed no significant nitrogen fixation potential by lake water samples. This may be a consequence of the inhibition of diazotrophy by nitrogen in the lake.},

Despite the substantial differences between these two classes of natural products, each is synthesized biologically under the control of exceptionally large, multifunctional proteins termed polyketide synthases (PKSs) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) that contain repeated, coordinated groups of active sites called modules, in which each module is responsible for catalysis of one complete cycle of polyketide or polypeptide chain elongation and associated functional group modifications. It has recently become possible to use molecular genetic methodology to alter the number, content, and order of such modules and, in so doing, to alter rationally the structure of the resultant products. This review considers the promise and challenges inherent in the combinatorial manipulation of PKS and NRPS structure in order to generate entirely "unnatural" products.},

Transcript abundance relative to total RNA increased with the growth rate. Changes in transcription from the dnaAp1 and dnaAp2 promoters that were induced by amino acid starvation and chloramphenicol and were relA dependent were correlated with the stringent response. The abundance of these transcripts per total RNA also decreased in spoT mutants as the severity of the mutation increased (guanosine 5'-diphosphate 3'-diphosphate [ppGpp] basal levels increased). Because expression of these promoters appears to be inhibited by ppGpp, it is proposed that one mechanism for coupling DNA replication to the growth rate of bacteria is through ppGpp synthesis at the ribosome.},

Maximum values of growth parameters obtained at the stationary growth phase of the strains were used for statistical calculation. Temperature had a significant (P <or= 0.05) effect on all growth parameters for each strain; correlations between the growth parameters were significant (P <or= 0.05-0.01). The maximum growth temperature or the temperature at which microbial growth was fastest was in no case the temperature at which the investigated strains produced the highest amount of biomass. All tested psychrophilic bacteria and yeast strains produced highest amounts of cells (as calculated per mg cell dry mass or per OD(600) unit) at 1 degrees C, while cell numbers of mesophiles were highest at 20 degrees C. Thus, cultivation temperatures close to the maximum growth temperature are not appropriate for studying psychrophiles.},

abstract = {Interactions between microorganisms shape microbial ecosystems. Systematic studies of mixed microbes in co-culture have revealed widespread potential for growth inhibition among marine heterotrophic bacteria, but similar synoptic studies have not been done with autotroph/heterotroph pairs, nor have precise descriptions of the temporal evolution of interactions been attempted in a high-throughput system. Here, we describe patterns in the outcome of pair-wise co-cultures between two ecologically distinct, yet closely related, strains of the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus and hundreds of heterotrophic marine bacteria. Co-culture with the collection of heterotrophic strains influenced the growth of Prochlorococcus strain MIT9313 much more than that of strain MED4, reflected both in the number of different types of interactions and in the magnitude of the effect of co-culture on various culture parameters. Enhancing interactions, where the presence of heterotrophic bacteria caused Prochlorococcus to grow faster and reach a higher final culture chlorophyll fluorescence, were much more common than antagonistic ones, and for a selected number of cases were shown to be mediated by diffusible compounds. In contrast, for one case at least, temporary inhibition of Prochlorococcus MIT9313 appeared to require close cellular proximity. Bacterial strains whose 16S gene sequences differed by 1-2\% tended to have similar effects on MIT9313, suggesting that the patterns of inhibition and enhancement in co-culture observed here are due to phylogenetically cohesive traits of these heterotrophs.},

abstract = {Alternative pre-mRNA splicing, the differential inclusion or exclusion of portions of a nascent transcript into the final protein-coding mRNA, is widely recognized to be a ubiquitous mechanism for controlling protein expression. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of alternative splicing is essential for deciphering post-transcriptional control of the genome. Pre-mRNA splicing in general is catalyzed by a large dynamic macromolecular machine known as the spliceosome. Notably, the recognition of the intron substrate by spliceosomal components and the assembly of these components to form a catalytic spliceosome occur through a network of highly combinatorial molecular interactions. Many, if not all, of these interactions are subject to regulation, forming the basis of alternative splicing. This minireview focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the diversity of mechanisms by which the spliceosome can be regulated so as to achieve precise control of alternative splicing under a range of cellular conditions.},

This isolate is rod shaped and, like Halobacterium sodomense, requires a relatively low level of sodium ions for growth and a very high level of magnesium; optimal growth occurs in the presence of 0.6 to 1.0 M Mg2+. The new strain resembles members of the Halobacterium saccharovorum-Halobacterium sodomense-Halobacterium trapanicum group in many physiological properties. However, the polar lipid composition of this organism is characteristic of representatives of the genus Haloferax; a sulfated diglycosyl diether is present, and the glycerol diether analog of phosphatidylglycerosulfate is absent. The G+C content of the DNA is 70 mol\%. We found that on the basis of 16S rRNA sequence data our new isolate occupies a position intermediate between the position of the Halobacterium saccharovorum group and the position of the genus Haloferax and is sufficiently different from the previously described members of the Halobacteriaceae to justify classification in a new species and a new genus. We propose the name Halobaculum gomorrense gen. nov., sp. nov. for this organism; the type strain is strain DSM 9297.},

abstract = {An opaque biochemical definition, an insufficient functional characterization, an interpolated database description, and a beautiful 3D structure with a wrong reaction. All these are elements of an exemplar case of misannotation in biological databases and confusion in the scientific literature concerning genes and enzymes acting on ureidoglycolate, an intermediate of purine catabolism. Here we show biochemical evidence for the relocation of genes assigned to EC 3.5.3.19 (ureidoglycolate hydrolase, releasing ammonia), such as allA of Escherichia coli or DAL3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to EC 4.3.2.3 (ureidoglycolate lyase, releasing urea). The EC 3.5.3.19 should be more appropriately named ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase and include genes equivalent to UAH of Arabidopsis thaliana. The distinction between ammonia- or urea-releasing activities from ureidoglycolate is relevant for the understanding of nitrogen metabolism in various organisms and of virulence factors in certain pathogens rather than a nomenclature problem. We trace the original fault in database annotation and provide a rationale for its incorporation and persistence in the scientific literature. Notwithstanding the technological distance, yet not surprising for the constancy of human nature, error categories and mechanisms established in the study of the work of amanuensis monks still apply to the modern curation of biological databases.},

abstract = {A consensus classification and nomenclature are defined for RNA backbone structure using all of the backbone torsion angles. By a consensus of several independent analysis methods, 46 discrete conformers are identified as suitably clustered in a quality-filtered, multidimensional dihedral angle distribution. Most of these conformers represent identifiable features or roles within RNA structures. The conformers are given two-character names that reflect the seven-angle delta epsilon zeta alpha beta gamma delta combinations empirically found favorable for the sugar-to-sugar "suite" unit within which the angle correlations are strongest (e.g., 1a for A-form, 5z for the start of S-motifs). Since the half-nucleotides are specified by a number for delta epsilon zeta and a lowercase letter for alpha beta gamma delta, this modular system can also be parsed to describe traditional nucleotide units (e.g., a1) or the dinucleotides (e.g., a1a1) that are especially useful at the level of crystallographic map fitting. This nomenclature can also be written as a string with two-character suite names between the uppercase letters of the base sequence (N1aG1gN1aR1aA1cN1a for a GNRA tetraloop), facilitating bioinformatic comparisons. Cluster means, standard deviations, coordinates, and examples are made available, as well as the Suitename software that assigns suite conformer names and conformer match quality (suiteness) from atomic coordinates. The RNA Ontology Consortium will combine this new backbone system with others that define base pairs, base-stacking, and hydrogen-bond relationships to provide a full description of RNA structural motifs.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

Currently, little is known about the detailed structural features of Z-RNA or its involvement in cellular processes. The discovery that certain interferon-response proteins have domains that can stabilize Z-RNA as well as Z-DNA opens the way for the study of Z-RNA. Here, we present the 2.25 A crystal structure of the Zalpha domain of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 (double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase) complexed to a dUr(CG)(3) duplex RNA. The Z-RNA helix is associated with a unique solvent pattern that distinguishes it from the otherwise similar conformation of Z-DNA. Based on the structure, we propose a model suggesting how differences in solvation lead to two types of Z-RNA structures. The interaction of Zalpha with Z-RNA demonstrates how the interferon-induced isoform of ADAR1 could be targeted toward selected dsRNAs containing purine-pyrimidine repeats, possibly of viral origin.},

abstract = {Despite a growing appreciation of their vast diversity in nature, mechanisms of speciation are poorly understood in Bacteria and Archaea. Here we use high-throughput genome sequencing to identify ongoing speciation in the thermoacidophilic Archaeon Sulfolobus islandicus. Patterns of homologous gene flow among genomes of 12 strains from a single hot spring in Kamchatka, Russia, demonstrate higher levels of gene flow within than between two persistent, coexisting groups, demonstrating that these microorganisms fit the biological species concept. Furthermore, rates of gene flow between two species are decreasing over time in a manner consistent with incipient speciation. Unlike other microorganisms investigated, we do not observe a relationship between genetic divergence and frequency of recombination along a chromosome, or other physical mechanisms that would reduce gene flow between lineages. Each species has its own genetic island encoding unique physiological functions and a unique growth phenotype that may be indicative of ecological specialization. Genetic differentiation between these coexisting groups occurs in large genomic "continents," indicating the topology of genomic divergence during speciation is not uniform and is not associated with a single locus under strong diversifying selection. These data support a model where species do not require physical barriers to gene flow but are maintained by ecological differentiation.},

Each of the 10 nearest-neighbor sequences is well-represented among the 45 oligonucleotides, and the sequences were chosen to minimize experimental errors in delta GO at 37 degrees C. These parameters predict melting temperatures of most oligonucleotide duplexes within 5 degrees C. This is about as good as can be expected from the nearest-neighbor model.

abstract = {Molecular structures and sequences are generally more revealing of evolutionary relationships than are classical phenotypes (particularly so among microorganisms). Consequently, the basis for the definition of taxa has progressively shifted from the organismal to the cellular to the molecular level. Molecular comparisons show that life on this planet divides into three primary groupings, commonly known as the eubacteria, the archaebacteria, and the eukaryotes. The three are very dissimilar, the differences that separate them being of a more profound nature than the differences that separate typical kingdoms, such as animals and plants. Unfortunately, neither of the conventionally accepted views of the natural relationships among living systems--i.e., the five-kingdom taxonomy or the eukaryote-prokaryote dichotomy--reflects this primary tripartite division of the living world. To remedy this situation we propose that a formal system of organisms be established in which above the level of kingdom there exists a new taxon called a "domain." Life on this planet would then be seen as comprising three domains, the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the Eucarya, each containing two or more kingdoms. (The Eucarya, for example, contain Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and a number of others yet to be defined). Although taxonomic structure within the Bacteria and Eucarya is not treated herein, Archaea is formally subdivided into the two kingdoms Euryarchaeota (encompassing the methanogens and their phenotypically diverse relatives) and Crenarchaeota (comprising the relatively tight clustering of extremely thermophilic archaebacteria, whose general phenotype appears to resemble most the ancestral phenotype of the Archaea.},

The capsid protein of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) can be induced to assemble into spherical particles of 30, 60, and 90 dimers. Based on examining assembly kinetics and reaction end points, we find that formation of uniform, ordered structures is not always a result of reactions that reach equilibrium. Equilibration or, alternatively, kinetic trapping can be identified by a straightforward analysis. Altering the assembly path of "spherical" particles is a means of controlling the distribution of products, which has broad applicability to self-assembly reactions.},

abstract = {TraJ is the essential activator of P(Y), the promoter of the F and F-like plasmid tra operon that encodes the majority of the proteins for bacterial conjugation. By combining error-prone PCR mutagenesis with a two-plasmid screen, we isolated 55 missense mutations in traJ, each affecting the ability of TraJ to activate P(Y). These mutations define two distinct functional clusters (amino acids [aa] 21 to 117 and aa 150 to 219). Limited proteolytic analysis of TraJ suggested that the N- and C-terminal functional clusters are two structurally distinct domains. Most TraJ mutants exhibited decreased intracellular protein levels, and the HslVU protease-chaperone pair was found to be responsible for degrading those mutants without extracytoplasmic stress-induced overexpression. In vivo cross-linking analysis of TraJ mutants indicated that the N-terminal domain is responsible for dimerization. This was confirmed by the finding that the purified N-terminal region of TraJ forms dimers in solution. The levels of dimerization and in vivo activities of TraJ mutants are well correlated, suggesting that dimerization of TraJ is required for its biological function.

abstract = {Protein nucleic acid interactions play a critical role in all steps of the gene expression pathway. Nucleic acid (NA) binding proteins interact with their partners, DNA or RNA, via distinct regions on their surface that are characterized by an ensemble of chemical, physical and geometrical properties. In this study, we introduce a novel methodology based on differential geometry, commonly used in face recognition, to characterize and predict NA binding surfaces on proteins. Applying the method on experimentally solved three-dimensional structures of proteins we successfully classify double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) binding proteins, with 83\% accuracy. We show that the method is insensitive to conformational changes that occur upon binding and can be applicable for de novo protein-function prediction. Remarkably, when concentrating on the zinc finger motif, we distinguish successfully between RNA and DNA binding interfaces possessing the same binding motif even within the same protein, as demonstrated for the RNA polymerase transcription-factor, TFIIIA. In conclusion, we present a novel methodology to characterize protein surfaces, which can accurately tell apart dsDNA from an ssRNA binding interfaces. The strength of our method in recognizing fine-tuned differences on NA binding interfaces make it applicable for many other molecular recognition problems, with potential implications for drug design.},

abstract = {An orange-coloured bacterial strain, designated R2A15-11(T), was isolated from greenhouse soil. The strain was found to be strictly aerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming and non-flagellated. The cells were short rods (0.7-0.9x1.0-1.5 mum) and produced flexirubin. Growth of the strain was observed at 10-35 degrees C, pH 5.0-8.0 and 0-3 \% (w/v) NaCl. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was MK-7. The major fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(15 : 1) G, iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH and summed feature 3 (comprising iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH and/or C(16 : 1)omega7c). The genomic DNA G+C content was 45.0 mol\%. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain R2A15-11(T) revealed a clear affiliation with the phylum Bacteroidetes, and the highest levels of sequence similarity were found with respect to Terrimonas ferruginea ATCC 13524(T) (91.5 \%), Terrimonas lutea DY(T) (90.2 \%), Niastella yeongjuensis GR20-13(T) (89.9 \%) and Niastella koreensis GR20-10(T) (89.7 \%). On the basis of the polyphasic evidence from this study, strain R2A15-11(T) represents a novel genus and species, for which the name Niabella aurantiaca gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Niabella aurantiaca is R2A15-11(T) (=KACC 11698(T)=DSM 17617(T)).},

abstract = {The difficulty associated with the cultivation of most microorganisms and the complexity of natural microbial assemblages, such as marine plankton or human microbiome, hinder genome reconstruction of representative taxa using cultivation or metagenomic approaches. Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91\% and 78\%, respectively. Only 0.24\% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.},

Organic and inorganic compounds served as substrates during aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Growth was inhibited by elemental sulfur. The cell wall was composed of a surface layer of hexameric protein complexes arranged on a p6 lattice. The core lipids consisted mainly of glycerol diphytanyl glycerol tetraethers with various degrees of cyclization. The G+C content was 52 mol\%. The new isolate resembled members of the genera Thermoproteus and Pyrobaculum by its ability to form characteristic terminal spherical bodies ("golf clubs"). On the basis of its 16S rRNA sequence, the new isolate exhibited a close relationship to the genus Pyrobaculum.

The challenge is to link these different approaches in a theoretical framework that relates the energetics of ion-RNA interactions to the spatial distribution of ions. This review distinguishes three different kinds of ion environments that differ in the extent of direct ion-RNA contacts and the degree to which the ion hydration is perturbed, and summarizes the current understanding of the way each environment relates to the overall energetics of RNA folding.},

Strain SMK-10T contained Q-8 as the predominant ubiquinone and C(16 : 1)omega7c and/or iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH, C(17 : 1), C(15 : 1) and iso-C(16 : 0) as major fatty acids.

There is also a large growth in the amount of experimental characterization of these RNA components. Despite this growth in information, it is still difficult for researchers to access RNA data, because key data resources for noncoding RNAs have not yet been created. The most pressing omission is the lack of a comprehensive RNA sequence database, much like UniProt, which provides a comprehensive set of protein knowledge. In this article we propose the creation of a new open public resource that we term RNAcentral, which will contain a comprehensive collection of RNA sequences and fill an important gap in the provision of biomedical databases. We envision RNA researchers from all over the world joining a federated RNAcentral network, contributing specialized knowledge and databases. RNAcentral would centralize key data that are currently held across a variety of databases, allowing researchers instant access to a single, unified resource. This resource would facilitate the next generation of RNA research and help drive further discoveries, including those that improve food production and human and animal health. We encourage additional RNA database resources and research groups to join this effort. We aim to obtain international network funding to further this endeavor.},

Located distant from the decoding region, between proteins S17 and S20, the results of this study suggest that this region of rRNA may act as a buffer or a spring between these two proteins during protein biosynthesis. During the assembly process, protein S17 apparently produces the major structural deformations in this region, causing it to be folded in a spring-like structure. Base C264 in this region shows erratic behavior during assembly and also shows time-dependent enhancement when elongation factor G with GTP is added to 70S ribosomes. Evidence is presented to suggest that this region of rRNA may be used to allow relative motion to occur between proteins S17 and S20 during translocation.},

abstract = {We characterized the microbiologically mediated oxidative precipitation of Fe(II) from coalmine-derived acidic mine drainage (AMD) along flow-paths at two sites in northern Pennsylvania. At the Gum Boot site, dissolved Fe(II) was efficiently removed from AMD whereas minimal Fe(II) removal occurred at the Fridays-2 site. Neither site received human intervention to treat the AMD. Culturable Fe(II) oxidizing bacteria were most abundant at sampling locations along the AMD flow path corresponding to greatest Fe(II) removal and where overlying water contained abundant dissolved O(2). Rates of Fe(II) oxidation determined in laboratory-based sediment incubations were also greatest at these sampling locations. Ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer analysis and sequencing of partial 16S rRNA genes recovered from sediment bacterial communities revealed similarities among populations at points receiving regular inputs of Fe(II)-rich AMD and provided evidence for the presence of bacterial lineages capable of Fe(II) oxidation. A notable difference between bacterial communities at the two sites was the abundance of Chloroflexi-affiliated 16S rRNA gene sequences in clone libraries derived from the Gum Boot sediments. Our results suggest that inexpensive and reliable AMD treatment strategies can be implemented by mimicking the conditions present at the Gum Boot field site.},

abstract = {A new concept has been introduced for molecular beacon DNA molecules. Molecular beacons are a new class of oligonucleotides that can report the presence of specific nucleic acids in both homogeneous solutions and at the liquid-solid interface. They emit an intense fluorescent signal only when hybridized to their target DNA or RNA molecules. Biotinylated molecular beacons have been designed and used for the development of ultrasensitive DNA sensors and for DNA molecular interaction studies at a solid-liquid interface. Molecular beacons have also been used to study protein-DNA interactions. They have provided a variety of exciting opportunities in DNA/RNA/protein studies.},

@article{Mokdad2006,
abstract = {We present a comprehensive structural, evolutionary and molecular dynamics (MD) study of the G/U wobble basepairs in the ribosome based on high-resolution crystal structures, including the recent Escherichia coli structure. These basepairs are classified according to their tertiary interactions, and sequence conservation at their positions is determined. G/U basepairs participating in tertiary interactions are more conserved than those lacking any interactions. Specific interactions occurring in the G/U shallow groove pocket--like packing interactions (P-interactions) and some phosphate backbone interactions (phosphate-in-pocket interactions)--lead to higher G/U conservation than others. Two salient cases of unique phylogenetic compensation are discovered. First, a P-interaction is conserved through a series of compensatory mutations involving all four participating nucleotides to preserve or restore the G/U in the optimal orientation. Second, a G/U basepair forming a P-interaction and another one forming a phosphate-in-pocket interaction are replaced by GNRA loops that maintain similar tertiary contacts. MD simulations were carried out on eight P-interactions. The specific GU/CG signature of this interaction observed in structure and sequence analysis was rationalized, and can now be used for improving sequence alignments.},

abstract = {Two psychrophilic flavobacteria, designated AT1042(T) and AT1048(T), were isolated from terrestrial samples from the Antarctic. Results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses indicated a close relationship of these isolates to Flavobacterium flevense (96.9 \% similarity for strain AT1042(T)) and Flavobacterium psychrolimnae (97.0 \% for strain AT1048(T)). Cells were non-motile and non-gliding. Flexirubin-type pigments were absent. Both isolates were psychrophilic, with an optimum and maximum growth temperature of about 15 and 20 degrees C, respectively. The major isoprenoid quinone, predominant cellular fatty acids and DNA G+C contents (35-37 mol\%) were consistent with the placement of the Antarctic isolates in the genus Flavobacterium. Phylogeny based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and several phenotypic characteristics could be used to differentiate these isolates from recognized Flavobacterium species. Despite high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (98.9 \%) between strains AT1042(T) and AT1048(T), they represented two distinct species as demonstrated by low genomic relatedness (34 \%) and a number of differential phenotypic characters. The polyphasic data presented in this study indicated that the new isolates should be classified within two novel species in the genus Flavobacterium. The names Flavobacterium weaverense sp. nov. (type strain AT1042(T) = IMSNU 14048(T) = KCTC 12223(T) = JCM 12384(T)) and Flavobacterium segetis sp. nov. (type strain AT1048(T) = IMSNU 14050(T) = KCTC 12224(T) = JCM 12385(T)) are proposed for these Antarctic isolates.},

abstract = {Crystals of 50S ribosomal subunits from Haloarcula marismortui diffracting to 2.9 A resolution were grown. Because of their large unit cells and the extremely weak diffracting power, almost all X-ray crystallographic analysis of these crystals must be performed with intense synchrotron radiation. At ambient temperature, all ribosomal crystals decay upon the first instance of X-irradiation. To overcome this severe sensitivity, procedures for data collection at cryo temperature were developed. Under these conditions the crystals can be irradiated for periods sufficient for the collection of more than one data set from an individual crystal (days or weeks) with no observable damage. They also can be stored for months, to resume interrupted measurements. To assist the interpretation of the anticipated electron density map, a specific internal nucleoprotein complex of protein HmaL1 and a stretch of H23S rRNA was isolated from the halophilic ribosome. The fragments of the 23S rRNA protected by the protein from nuclease digestion were sequenced. Alignment of the sequences of some archaebacterial L1-specific RNA fragments to the corresponding parts of eubacterial and eukaryotic rDNAs, localized the sequence identities to two distinct regions. Chimeric complexes were reconstituted with the corresponding E. coli ribosomal components, indicating a rather high homology, despite the evolution distance. A feasible secondary structure of the rRNA stretch participating in this complex was found to be compatible with the one proposed for the corresponding part in the E. coli ribosomal RNA.},

abstract = {The taxonomic positions of three strains of marine gliding bacteria, TISTR 1736, TISTR 1741 and TISTR 1750(T), isolated from the southern coastline of Thailand were evaluated by using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the three isolates formed a distinct lineage within the family 'Flammeovirgaceae', phylum Bacteroidetes, and were related to the genus Flexithrix. The DNA G+C contents of the isolates were in the range 40-43 mol\%. The major respiratory quinone was MK-7. The major cellular fatty acids were 16 : 1omega5c (cis-5-hexadecenoic acid) and 15 : 0 (pentadecanoic acid). The major hydroxyl fatty acids were 3-OH 17 : 0 (3-hydroxyheptadecanoic acid), 3-OH 15 : 0 (3-hydroxypentadecanoic acid) and 3-OH 16 : 0 (3-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid). On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, genotypic and phylogenetic data, these marine bacteria are considered to represent a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Rapidithrix thailandica gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Rapidithrix thailandica is TISTR 1750(T) (=IAM 15448(T)).},

abstract = {We present a new, first-of-its-kind, fully automated computational tool MOTIF-EM for identifying regions or domains or motifs in cryoEM maps of large macromolecular assemblies (such as chaperonins, viruses, etc.) that remain conformationally conserved. As a by-product, regions in structures that are not conserved are revealed: this can indicate local molecular flexibility related to biological activity. MOTIF-EM takes cryoEM volumetric maps as inputs. The technique used by MOTIF-EM to detect conserved sub-structures is inspired by a recent breakthrough in 2D object recognition. The technique works by constructing rotationally invariant, low-dimensional representations of local regions in the input cryoEM maps. Correspondences are established between the reduced representations (by comparing them using a simple metric) across the input maps. The correspondences are clustered using hash tables and graph theory is used to retrieve conserved structural domains or motifs. MOTIF-EM has been used to extract conserved domains occurring in large macromolecular assembly maps, including as those of viruses P22 and epsilon 15, Ribosome 70S, GroEL, that remain structurally conserved in different functional states. Our method can also been used to build atomic models for some maps. We also used MOTIF-EM to identify the conserved folds shared among dsDNA bacteriophages HK97, Epsilon 15, and \^{o}29, though they have low-sequence similarity.

We present a novel geometric method for the characterization and identification of structural motifs in 3D rRNA molecules. This method enables the efficient recognition of known 3D motifs, such as tetraloops, E-loops, kink-turns and others. Furthermore, it provides a new way of characterizing complex 3D motifs, notably junctions, that have been defined and identified in the secondary structure but have not been analyzed and classified in three dimensions. We demonstrate the relevance and utility of our approach by applying it to the Haloarcula marismortui large ribosomal unit.

@article{Allers2001,
abstract = {Until recently, drawing general conclusions about RNA recognition by proteins has been hindered by the paucity of high-resolution structures. We have analyzed 45 PDB entries of protein-RNA complexes to explore the underlying chemical principles governing both specific and non-sequence specific binding. To facilitate the analysis, we have constructed a database of interactions using ENTANGLE, a JAVA-based program that uses available structural models in their PDB format and searches for appropriate hydrogen bonding, stacking, electrostatic, hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions. The resulting database of interactions reveals correlations that suggest the basis for the discrimination of RNA from DNA and for base-specific recognition. The data illustrate both major and minor interaction strategies employed by families of proteins such as tRNA synthetases, ribosomal proteins, or RNA recognition motifs with their RNA targets. Perhaps most surprisingly, specific RNA recognition appears to be mediated largely by interactions of amide and carbonyl groups in the protein backbone with the edge of the RNA base. In cases where a base accepts a proton, the dominant amino acid donor is arginine, whereas in cases where the base donates a proton, the predominant acceptor is the backbone carbonyl group, not a side-chain group. This is in marked contrast to DNA-protein interactions, which are governed predominantly by amino acid side-chain interactions with functional groups that are presented in the accessible major groove. RNA recognition often proceeds through loops, bulges, kinks and other irregular structures that permit use of all the RNA functional groups and this is seen throughout the protein-RNA interaction database.},

Here we describe the crystal structure of the Thermus thermophilus RRF bound to a 70S ribosomal complex containing a stop codon in the A site, a transfer RNA anticodon stem-loop in the P site and tRNA(fMet) in the E site. The work demonstrates that structures of translation factors bound to 70S ribosomes can be determined at reasonably high resolution. Contrary to earlier reports, we did not observe any RRF-induced changes in bridges connecting the two subunits. This suggests that such changes are not a direct requirement for or consequence of RRF binding but possibly arise from the subsequent stabilization of a hybrid state of the ribosome.},

abstract = {Analysis of the Haloarcula marismortui large ribosomal subunit has revealed a common RNA structure that we call the kink-turn, or K-turn. The six K-turns in H.marismortui 23S rRNA superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 1.7 A. There are two K-turns in the structure of Thermus thermophilus 16S rRNA, and the structures of U4 snRNA and L30e mRNA fragments form K-turns. The structure has a kink in the phosphodiester backbone that causes a sharp turn in the RNA helix. Its asymmetric internal loop is flanked by C-G base pairs on one side and sheared G-A base pairs on the other, with an A-minor interaction between these two helical stems. A derived consensus secondary structure for the K-turn includes 10 consensus nucleotides out of 15, and predicts its presence in the 5'-UTR of L10 mRNA, helix 78 in Escherichia coli 23S rRNA and human RNase MRP. Five K-turns in 23S rRNA interact with nine proteins. While the observed K-turns interact with proteins of unrelated structures in different ways, they interact with L7Ae and two homologous proteins in the same way.},

@article{Holbrook2005,
abstract = {The database of RNA structure has grown tremendously since the crystal structure analyses of ribosomal subunits in 2000-2001. During the past year, the trend toward determining the structure of large, complex biological RNAs has accelerated, with the analysis of three intact group I introns, A- and B-type ribonuclease P RNAs, a riboswitch-substrate complex and other structures. The growing database of RNA structures, coupled with efforts directed at the standardization of nomenclature and classification of motifs, has resulted in the identification and characterization of numerous RNA secondary and tertiary structure motifs. Because a large proportion of RNA structure can now be shown to be composed of these recurring structural motifs, a view of RNA as a modular structure built from a combination of these building blocks and tertiary linkers is beginning to emerge. At the same time, however, more detailed analysis of water, metal, ligand and protein binding to RNA is revealing the effect of these moieties on folding and structure formation. The balance between the views of RNA structure either as strictly a construct of preformed building blocks linked in a limited number of ways or as a flexible polymer assuming a global fold influenced by its environment will be the focus of current and future RNA structural biology.},

abstract = {Many exciting discoveries have recently revealed the versatility of RNA and its importance in a variety of functions within the cell. Since the structural features of RNA are of major importance to their biological function, there is much interest in predicting RNA structure, either in free form or in interaction with various ligands, including proteins, metabolites and other molecules. In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have developed novel RNA algorithms for predicting RNA secondary and tertiary structures. In this review, we describe current experimental and computational advances and discuss recent ideas that are transforming the traditional view of RNA folding. To evaluate the performance of the most recent RNA 3D folding algorithms, we provide a comparative study in order to test the performance of available 3D structure prediction algorithms for an RNA data set of 43 structures of various lengths and motifs. We find that the algorithms vary widely in terms of prediction quality across different RNA lengths and topologies; most predictions have very large root mean square deviations from the experimental structure. We conclude by outlining some suggestions for future RNA folding research.},

abstract = {In this paper we present SFCHECK, a stand-alone software package that features a unified set of procedures for evaluating the structure-factor data obtained from X-ray diffraction experiments and for assessing the agreement of the atomic coordinates with these data. The evaluation is performed completely automatically, and produces a concise PostScript pictorial output similar to that of PROCHECK [Laskowski, MacArthur, Moss \& Thornton (1993). J. Appl. Cryst. 26, 283-291], greatly facilitating visual inspection of the results. The required inputs are the structure-factor amplitudes and the atomic coordinates. Having those, the program summarizes relevant information on the deposited structure factors and evaluates their quality using criteria such as data completeness, structure-factor uncertainty and the optical resolution computed from the Patterson origin peak. The dependence of various parameters on the nominal resolution (d spacing) is also given. To evaluate the global agreement of the atomic model with the experimental data, the program recomputes the R factor, the correlation coefficient between observed and calculated structure-factor amplitudes and Rfree (when appropriate). In addition, it gives several estimates of the average error in the atomic coordinates. The local agreement between the model and the electron-density map is evaluated on a per-residue basis, considering separately the macromolecule backbone and side-chain atoms, as well as solvent atoms and heterogroups. Among the criteria are the normalized average atomic displacement, the local density correlation coefficient and the polymer chain connectivity. The possibility of computing these criteria using the omit-map procedure is also provided. The described software should be a valuable tool in monitoring the refinement procedure and in assessing structures deposited in databases.},

@article{Preissner1998,
abstract = {Molecular surface areas of proteins are responsible for selective binding of ligands and protein-protein recognition, and are considered the basis for specific interactions between different parts of a protein. This basic principle leads us to study the interfaces within proteins as a learning set for intermolecular recognition processes of ligands like substrates, coenzymes, etc., and for prediction of contacts occurring during protein folding and association. For this purpose, we defined interfaces as pairs of matching molecular surface patches between neighboring secondary structural elements. All such interfaces from known protein structures were collected in a comprehensive data bank of interfaces in proteins (DIP). The up-to-date DIP contains interface files for 351 selected Brookhaven Protein Data Bank entries with a total of about 160,000 surface elements formed by 12,475 secondary structures. For special purposes, the inclusion of additional structures or selection of subgroups of proteins can be performed in an easy and straightforward manner. Atomic coordinates of the constituents of molecular surface patches are directly accessible as well as the corresponding contact distances from given atoms to their neighboring secondary structural elements. As a rule, independent of the type of secondary structure, the molecular surface patches of the secondary structural elements can be described as quite flat bodies with a length to width to depth ratio of about 3:2:1 for patches consisting of more than ten atoms. The relative orientation between two docking patches is strongly restricted, due to the narrow distribution of the distances between their centers of mass and of the angles between their normal lines, respectively. The existing retrieval system for the DIP allows selection (out of the set of molecular patches) according to different criteria, such as geometric features, atomic composition, type of secondary structure, contacts, etc. A fast, sequence-independent 3-D superposition procedure was developed for automatic searches for geometrically similar surface areas. Using this procedure, we found a large number of structurally similar interfaces of up to 30 atoms in completely unrelated protein structures.},

The models themselves have a longer history, going back over 30 years, although many novel variants have arisen since that time. The function of the models in biological sequence analysis is to summarize the information concerning what is known as a motif or a domain in bioinformatics, and to provide a tool for discovering instances of that motif or domain in a separate sequence segment. We will introduce the motif models in stages, beginning from very simple, non-stochastic versions, progressively becoming more complex, until we reach modern profile HMMs for motifs. A second example will come from gene finding using sequence data from one or two species, where generalized HMMs or generalized pair HMMs have proved to be very effective.},

abstract = {Explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out for sarcin-ricin domain (SRD) motifs from 23S (Escherichia coli) and 28S (rat) rRNAs. The SRD motif consists of GAGA tetraloop, G-bulged cross-strand A-stack, flexible region and duplex part. Detailed analysis of the overall dynamics, base pairing, hydration, cation binding and other SRD features is presented. The SRD is surprisingly static in multiple 25 ns long simulations and lacks any non-local motions, with root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values between averaged MD and high-resolution X-ray structures of 1-1.4 A. Modest dynamics is observed in the tetraloop, namely, rotation of adenine in its apex and subtle reversible shift of the tetraloop with respect to the adjacent base pair. The deformed flexible region in low-resolution rat X-ray structure is repaired by simulations. The simulations reveal few backbone flips, which do not affect positions of bases and do not indicate a force field imbalance. Non-Watson-Crick base pairs are rigid and mediated by long-residency water molecules while there are several modest cation-binding sites around SRD. In summary, SRD is an unusually stiff rRNA building block. Its intrinsic structural and dynamical signatures seen in simulations are strikingly distinct from other rRNA motifs such as Loop E and Kink-turns.},

abstract = {Recent interest in non-coding RNA transcripts has resulted in a rapid increase of deposited RNA structures in the Protein Data Bank. However, a characterization and functional classification of the RNA structure and function space have only been partially addressed. Here, we introduce the SARA program for pair-wise alignment of RNA structures as a web server for structure-based RNA function assignment. The SARA server relies on the SARA program, which aligns two RNA structures based on a unit-vector root-mean-square approach. The likely accuracy of the SARA alignments is assessed by three different P-values estimating the statistical significance of the sequence, secondary structure and tertiary structure identity scores, respectively. Our benchmarks, which relied on a set of 419 RNA structures with known SCOR structural class, indicate that at a negative logarithm of mean P-value higher or equal than 2.5, SARA can assign the correct or a similar SCOR class to 81.4\% and 95.3\% of the benchmark set, respectively. The SARA server is freely accessible via the World Wide Web at http://sgu.bioinfo.cipf.es/services/SARA/.},

The algorithm has a worst case complexity of \$\{\backslash cal O\}(N\^{}6)\$ in time and \$\{\backslash cal O\}(N\^{}4)\$ in storage. The description of the algorithm is complex, which led us to adopt a useful graphical representation (Feynman diagrams) borrowed from quantum field theory. We present an implementation of the algorithm that generates the optimal minimum energy structure for a single RNA sequence, using standard RNA folding thermodynamic parameters augmented by a few parameters describing the thermodynamic stability of pseudoknots. We demonstrate the properties of the algorithm by using it to predict structures for several small pseudoknotted and non-pseudoknotted RNAs. Although the time and memory demands of the algorithm are steep, we believe this is the first algorithm to be able to fold optimal (minimum energy) pseudoknotted RNAs with the accepted RNA thermodynamic model.},

R-Coffee uses an alignment-scoring scheme that incorporates secondary structure information within the alignment. It works particularly well as an alignment improver and can be combined with any existing sequence alignment method. In this work, we used R-Coffee to compute multiple sequence alignments combining the pairwise output of sequence aligners and structural aligners. We show that R-Coffee can improve the accuracy of all the sequence aligners. We also show that the consistency-based component of T-Coffee can improve the accuracy of several structural aligners. R-Coffee was tested on 388 BRAliBase reference datasets and on 11 longer Cmfinder datasets. Altogether our results suggest that the best protocol for aligning short sequences (less than 200 nt) is the combination of R-Coffee with the RNA pairwise structural aligner Consan. We also show that the simultaneous combination of the four best sequence alignment programs with R-Coffee produces alignments almost as accurate as those obtained with R-Coffee/Consan. Finally, we show that R-Coffee can also be used to align longer datasets beyond the usual scope of structural aligners. R-Coffee is freely available for download, along with documentation, from the T-Coffee web site (www.tcoffee.org).},

Understanding the architecture and function of active RNA molecules requires methods for comparing and analyzing their 3D structures. While structural alignment of short RNAs is achievable in a reasonable amount of time, large structures represent much bigger challenge. Here, we present the SETTER web server for the RNA structure pairwise comparison utilizing the SETTER (SEcondary sTructure-based TERtiary Structure Similarity Algorithm) algorithm. The SETTER method divides an RNA structure into the set of non-overlapping structural elements called generalized secondary structure units (GSSUs). The SETTER algorithm scales as O(n(2)) with the size of a GSSUs and as O(n) with the number of GSSUs in the structure. This scaling gives SETTER its high speed as the average size of the GSSU remains constant irrespective of the size of the structure. However, the favorable speed of the algorithm does not compromise its accuracy. The SETTER web server together with the stand-alone implementation of the SETTER algorithm are freely accessible at http://siret.cz/setter.},

The enzyme is one of only two ribozymes which can be found in all kingdoms of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya). Most forms of RNase P are ribonucleoproteins; the bacterial enzyme possesses a single catalytic RNA and one small protein. However, in archaea and eukarya the enzyme has evolved an increasingly more complex protein composition, whilst retaining a structurally related RNA subunit. The reasons for this additional complexity are not currently understood. Furthermore, the eukaryotic RNase P has evolved into several different enzymes including a nuclear activity, organellar activities, and the evolution of a distinct but closely related enzyme, RNase MRP, which has different substrate specificities, primarily involved in ribosomal RNA biogenesis. Here we examine the relationship between the bacterial and archaeal RNase P with the eukaryotic enzyme, and summarize recent progress in characterizing the archaeal enzyme. We review current information regarding the nuclear RNase P and RNase MRP enzymes in the eukaryotes, focusing on the relationship between these enzymes by examining their composition, structure and functions.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm, based on the multidimensional QR factorization, to remove redundancy from a multiple structural alignment by choosing representative protein structures that best preserve the phylogenetic tree topology of the homologous group. The classical QR factorization with pivoting, developed as a fast numerical solution to eigenvalue and linear least-squares problems of the form Ax=b, was designed to re-order the columns of A by increasing linear dependence. Removing the most linear dependent columns from A leads to the formation of a minimal basis set which well spans the phase space of the problem at hand. By recasting the problem of redundancy in multiple structural alignments into this framework, in which the matrix A now describes the multiple alignment, we adapted the QR factorization to produce a minimal basis set of protein structures which best spans the evolutionary (phase) space. The non-redundant and representative profiles obtained from this procedure, termed evolutionary profiles, are shown in initial results to outperform well-tested profiles in homology detection searches over a large sequence database. A measure of structural similarity between homologous proteins, Q(H), is presented. By properly accounting for the effect and presence of gaps, a phylogenetic tree computed using this metric is shown to be congruent with the maximum-likelihood sequence-based phylogeny. The results indicate that evolutionary information is indeed recoverable from the comparative analysis of protein structure alone. Applications of the QR ordering and this structural similarity metric to analyze the evolution of structure among key, universally distributed proteins involved in translation, and to the selection of representatives from an ensemble of NMR structures are also discussed.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of identifying common three-dimensional substructures between proteins. Our method is based on comparing the shape of the alpha-carbon backbone structures of the proteins in order to find three-dimensional (3D) rigid motions that bring portions of the geometric structures into correspondence. We propose a geometric representation of protein backbone chains that is compact yet allows for similarity measures that are robust against noise and outliers. This representation encodes the structure of the backbone as a sequence of unit vectors, defined by each adjacent pair of alpha-carbons. We then define a measure of the similarity of two protein structures based on the root mean squared (RMS) distance between corresponding orientation vectors of the two proteins. Our measure has several advantages over measures that are commonly used for comparing protein shapes, such as the minimum RMS distance between the 3D positions of corresponding atoms in two proteins. A key advantage is that this new measure behaves well for identifying common substructures, in contrast with position-based measures where the nonmatching portions of the structure dominate the measure. At the same time, it avoids the quadratic space and computational difficulties associated with methods based on distance matrices and contact maps. We show applications of our approach to detecting common contiguous substructures in pairs of proteins, as well as the more difficult problem of identifying common protein domains (i.e., larger substructures that are not necessarily contiguous along the protein chain).},

abstract = {Understanding patterns of rRNA evolution is critical for a number of fields, including structure prediction and phylogeny. The standard model of RNA evolution is that compensatory mutations in stems make up the bulk of the changes between homologous sequences, while unpaired regions are relatively homogeneous. We show that considerable heterogeneity exists in the relative rates of evolution of different secondary structure categories (stems, loops, bulges, etc.) within the rRNA, and that in eukaryotes, loops actually evolve much faster than stems. Both rates of evolution and abundance of different structural categories vary with distance from functionally important parts of the ribosome such as the tRNA path and the peptidyl transferase center. For example, fast-evolving residues are mainly found at the surface; stems are enriched at the subunit interface, and junctions near the peptidyl transferase center. However, different secondary structure categories evolve at different rates even when these effects are accounted for. The results demonstrate that relative rates and patterns of evolution are lineage specific, suggesting that phylogenetically and structurally specific models will improve evolutionary and structural predictions.},

abstract = {A dynamic programming algorithm for prediction of RNA secondary structure has been revised to accommodate folding constraints determined by chemical modification and to include free energy increments for coaxial stacking of helices when they are either adjacent or separated by a single mismatch. Furthermore, free energy parameters are revised to account for recent experimental results for terminal mismatches and hairpin, bulge, internal, and multibranch loops. To demonstrate the applicability of this method, in vivo modification was performed on 5S rRNA in both Escherichia coli and Candida albicans with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate, dimethyl sulfate, and kethoxal. The percentage of known base pairs in the predicted structure increased from 26.3\% to 86.8\% for the E. coli sequence by using modification constraints. For C. albicans, the accuracy remained 87.5\% both with and without modification data. On average, for these sequences and a set of 14 sequences with known secondary structure and chemical modification data taken from the literature, accuracy improves from 67\% to 76\%. This enhancement primarily reflects improvement for three sequences that are predicted with <40\% accuracy on the basis of energetics alone. For these sequences, inclusion of chemical modification constraints improves the average accuracy from 28\% to 78\%. For the 11 sequences with <6\% pseudoknotted base pairs, structures predicted with constraints from chemical modification contain on average 84\% of known canonical base pairs.},

abstract = {Based on the experimentally determined atomic coordinates for RNA helices and the self-avoiding walks of the P (phosphate) and C4 (carbon) atoms in the diamond lattice for the polynucleotide loop conformations, we derive a set of conformational entropy parameters for RNA pseudoknots. Based on the entropy parameters, we develop a folding thermodynamics model that enables us to compute the sequence-specific RNA pseudoknot folding free energy landscape and thermodynamics. The model is validated through extensive experimental tests both for the native structures and for the folding thermodynamics. The model predicts strong sequence-dependent helix-loop competitions in the pseudoknot stability and the resultant conformational switches between different hairpin and pseudoknot structures. For instance, for the pseudoknot domain of human telomerase RNA, a native-like and a misfolded hairpin intermediates are found to coexist on the (equilibrium) folding pathways, and the interplay between the stabilities of these intermediates causes the conformational switch that may underlie a human telomerase disease.},

abstract = {RNA secondary structures can be divided into helical regions composed of canonical Watson-Crick and related base pairs, as well as single-stranded regions such as hairpin loops, internal loops, and junctions. These elements function as building blocks in the design of diverse RNA molecules with various fundamental functions in the cell. To better understand the intricate architecture of three-dimensional (3D) RNAs, we analyze existing RNA four-way junctions in terms of base-pair interactions and 3D configurations. Specifically, we identify nine broad junction families according to coaxial stacking patterns and helical configurations. We find that helices within junctions tend to arrange in roughly parallel and perpendicular patterns and stabilize their conformations using common tertiary motifs such as coaxial stacking, loop-helix interaction, and helix packing interaction. Our analysis also reveals a number of highly conserved base-pair interaction patterns and novel tertiary motifs such as A-minor-coaxial stacking combinations and sarcin/ricin motif variants. Such analyses of RNA building blocks can ultimately help in the difficult task of RNA 3D structure prediction.},

abstract = {DEAD-box RNA helicases of the bacterial DbpA subfamily are localized to their biological substrate when a carboxy-terminal RNA recognition motif domain binds tightly and specifically to a segment of 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) that includes hairpin 92 of the peptidyl transferase center. A complex between a fragment of 23S rRNA and the RNA binding domain (RBD) of the Bacillus subtilis DbpA protein YxiN was crystallized and its structure was determined to 2.9 A resolution, revealing an RNA recognition mode that differs from those observed with other RNA recognition motifs. The RBD is bound between two RNA strands at a three-way junction. Multiple phosphates of the RNA backbone interact with an electropositive band generated by lysines of the RBD. Nucleotides of the single-stranded loop of hairpin 92 interact with the RBD, including the guanosine base of G2553, which forms three hydrogen bonds with the peptide backbone. A G2553U mutation reduces the RNA binding affinity by 2 orders of magnitude, confirming that G2553 is a sequence specificity determinant in RNA binding. Binding of the RBD to 23S rRNA in the late stages of ribosome subunit maturation would position the ATP-binding duplex destabilization fragment of the protein for interaction with rRNA in the peptidyl transferase cleft of the subunit, allowing it to "melt out" unstable secondary structures and allow proper folding.},

This paper reviews the intrinsic network of modifications in the structural core of the tRNA, which governs structural flexibility and rigidity to fine-tune the molecule to peak performance and to regulate its steady-state level. Structural effects of RNA modifications range from nanometer-scale rearrangements to subtle restrictions of conformational space on the angstrom scale. Structural stabilization resulting from nucleotide modification results in increased thermal stability and translates into protection against unspecific degradation by bases and nucleases. Several mechanisms of specific degradation of hypomodified tRNA, which were only recently discovered, provide a link between structural and metabolic stability.},

The juxtaposition of the two helices is kept by a complex system of tertiary interactions spread over several layers of stacked nucleotides. In the center of this arrangement, the ribose of a nucleotide from one helix is specifically packed with the ribose and the minor-groove edge of a guanosine from the other helix. In total, we found eight G-ribo motifs in both ribosomal subunits.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We are interested in the problem of predicting secondary structure for small sets of homologous RNAs, by incorporating limited comparative sequence information into an RNA folding model. The Sankoff algorithm for simultaneous RNA folding and alignment is a basis for approaches to this problem. There are two open problems in applying a Sankoff algorithm: development of a good unified scoring system for alignment and folding and development of practical heuristics for dealing with the computational complexity of the algorithm. RESULTS: We use probabilistic models (pair stochastic context-free grammars, pairSCFGs) as a unifying framework for scoring pairwise alignment and folding. A constrained version of the pairSCFG structural alignment algorithm was developed which assumes knowledge of a few confidently aligned positions (pins). These pins are selected based on the posterior probabilities of a probabilistic pairwise sequence alignment. CONCLUSION: Pairwise RNA structural alignment improves on structure prediction accuracy relative to single sequence folding. Constraining on alignment is a straightforward method of reducing the runtime and memory requirements of the algorithm. Five practical implementations of the pairwise Sankoff algorithm - this work (Consan), David Mathews' Dynalign, Ian Holmes' Stemloc, Ivo Hofacker's PMcomp, and Jan Gorodkin's FOLDALIGN - have comparable overall performance with different strengths and weaknesses.},

The first step is to extract the fundamental patterns of gene expression inherent in the data. This paper describes the application of self-organizing maps, a type of mathematical cluster analysis that is particularly well suited for recognizing and classifying features in complex, multidimensional data. The method has been implemented in a publicly available computer package, GENECLUSTER, that performs the analytical calculations and provides easy data visualization. To illustrate the value of such analysis, the approach is applied to hematopoietic differentiation in four well studied models (HL-60, U937, Jurkat, and NB4 cells). Expression patterns of some 6,000 human genes were assayed, and an online database was created. GENECLUSTER was used to organize the genes into biologically relevant clusters that suggest novel hypotheses about hematopoietic differentiation-for example, highlighting certain genes and pathways involved in "differentiation therapy" used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.},

Nevertheless, the lack in publicly available sequence information is severely limiting advances in CHO cell biology, including the exploration of microRNAs (miRNA) as tools for CHO cell characterization and engineering. In an effort to identify and annotate both conserved and novel CHO miRNAs in the absence of a Chinese hamster genome, we deep-sequenced small RNA fractions of 6 biotechnologically relevant cell lines and mapped the resulting reads to an artificial reference sequence consisting of all known miRNA hairpins. Read alignment patterns and read count ratios of 5' and 3' mature miRNAs were obtained and used for an independent classification into miR/miR* and 5p/3p miRNA pairs and discrimination of miRNAs from other non-coding RNAs, resulting in the annotation of 387 mature CHO miRNAs. The quantitative content of next-generation sequencing data was analyzed and confirmed using qPCR, to find that miRNAs are markers of cell status. Finally, cDNA sequencing of 26 validated targets of miR-17-92 suggests conserved functions for miRNAs in CHO cells, which together with the now publicly available sequence information sets the stage for developing novel RNAi tools for CHO cell engineering.},

Starting from simplified linear-chain conformations, RNA molecules (<50 nt) fold to native-like structures within half an hour of simulation, facilitating rapid RNA structure prediction. All-atom reconstruction of energetically stable conformations generates iFoldRNA predicted RNA structures. The predicted RNA structures are within 2-5 A root mean squre deviations (RMSDs) from corresponding experimentally derived structures. RNA folding parameters including specific heat, contact maps, simulation trajectories, gyration radii, RMSDs from native state, fraction of native-like contacts are accessible from iFoldRNA.

This demonstrates how crucial the consideration of all base-pairing interactions is in filling the gap between sequence and structure.

abstract = {The mammalian nervous system expresses numerous noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). We propose that ncRNAs are capable of coupling the digital information universe of nucleic acids with the analog universe of cellular protein interactions. ncRNAs could contribute to the success of the organism's information processing in several ways. First, ncRNAs would allow for efficient coupling of energy with information, wherein less energy is required to represent and process more information, condensed in analog and digital form, into smaller spatial and temporal domains, ideal for the environments found in neural tissues. Second, ncRNAs would permit the rapid acquisition of information from the environment, along with the rapid flexible processing and elimination of that information when it is no longer necessary. Third, ncRNAs would facilitate accelerated evolution of an organism's information content and functional computational systems. This emerging panorama might open new dimensions of information processing in the nervous system.},

Each individual structure mapping experiment reveals specific information about the structure and/or dynamics of the nucleic acid. Currently, there is no simple approach for making these data publically available in a standardized format. We therefore developed a standard for reporting the results of single nucleotide resolution nucleic acid structure mapping experiments, or SNRNASMs. We propose a schema for sharing nucleic acid chemical probing data that uses generic public servers for storing, retrieving, and searching the data. We have also developed a consistent nomenclature (ontology) within the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI), which provides unique identifiers (termed persistent URLs, or PURLs) for classifying the data.

abstract = {Structured RNA molecules form complex 3D architectures stabilized by multiple interactions involving the nucleotide base, sugar and phosphate moieties. A significant percentage of the bases in structured RNA molecules in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) hydrogen-bond with phosphates of other nucleotides. By extracting and superimposing base-phosphate (BPh) interactions from a reduced-redundancy subset of 3D structures from the PDB, we identified recurrent phosphate-binding sites on the RNA bases. Quantum chemical calculations were carried out on model systems representing each BPh interaction. The calculations show that the centers of each cluster obtained from the structure superpositions correspond to energy minima on the potential energy hypersurface. The calculations also show that the most stable phosphate-binding sites occur on the Watson-Crick edge of guanine and the Hoogsteen edge of cytosine. We modified the 'Find RNA 3D' (FR3D) software suite to automatically find and classify BPh interactions. Comparison of the 3D structures of the 16S and 23S rRNAs of Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus revealed that most BPh interactions are phylogenetically conserved and they occur primarily in hairpin, internal or junction loops or as part of tertiary interactions. Bases that form BPh interactions, which are conserved in the rRNA 3D structures are also conserved in homologous rRNA sequence alignments.},

With new structured RNAs constituting a central class of cellular regulators discovered every year, the need for swift and reliable modelling methods is more crucial than ever. The pragmatic method based on interactive all-atom molecular modelling relies on the observation that specific structural motifs are recurrently found in RNA sequences. Once identified by a combination of comparative sequence analysis and biochemical data, the motifs composing the secondary structure of a given RNA can be extruded in three dimensions (3D) and used as building blocks assembled manually during a bioinformatic interactive process. Comparing the models to the corresponding crystal structures has validated the method as being powerful to predict the RNA topology and architecture while being less accurate regarding the prediction of base-base interactions. These aspects as well as the necessary steps towards automation will be discussed.},

@article{Dutheil2010a,
abstract = {It has long been accepted that the structural constraints stemming from the 3D structure of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) lead to coevolution through compensating mutations between interacting sites. State-of-the-art methods for detecting coevolving sites, however, while reaching high levels of specificity and sensitivity for Watson-Crick (WC) pairs of the helices defining the secondary structure, only scarcely reveal tertiary interactions occurring at the level of the 3D structure. In order to understand the relative failure of coevolutionary methods to detect such interactions, we analyze 2,682 interacting sites derived from high-resolution structures, which include a comprehensive data set of rRNA sequences from Archaea and Bacteria. We report a striking difference in the amount of coevolution between WC and non-WC pairs. In order to understand this pattern, we derive fitness landscapes from the geometry of base pairing interactions and construct neutral networks of substitutions for each type of interaction. These networks show that coevolution is a property of WC pairs because, unlike non-WC pairs, their landscapes exhibit fitness valleys, a single mutation in a WC pair resulting in a fitness drop. Second, we used the inferred neutral networks to estimate the level of constraint acting on each type of base pair and show that it correlates negatively with the observed rate of substitutions for all non-WC pairs. WC pairs appear as outliers, fixing more substitutions than expected according to their level of constraint. We here propose that the rate of substitution in WC pairs is due to coevolution resulting from constraints acting at intermediate levels of organization, namely the one of the helical stem with its forming WC pairs. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report a significant excess of intrahelical, inter-WC pairs coevolution compared with interhelices pairs. Altogether, these results show that detailed biochemical knowledge is required and has to be incorporated into evolutionary reasoning in order to understand the fine patterns of variation at the molecular level. They also demonstrate that coevolutionary analysis provides almost exclusively 2D information and only little 3D signal.},

This structural motif is canonically comprised of two stems (one with tandem A.G base pairs, the other with Watson-Crick pairs) linked by an asymmetric internal loop. L7Ae recognizes conventional K-turns in ribosomal and box C/D RNAs but also binds specifically to some box H/ACA RNAs at terminal stem loops. These have the A.G paired stem, but lack the Watson-Crick stem. The structure of Methanococcus jannaschii L7Ae bound to a symmetric duplex RNA without Watson-Crick stems demonstrates how a binding site for this component of diverse ribonucleoprotein complexes can be constructed with only the A.G stem and the loop. The RNA adopts a functional conformation with the aid of a base triple and tight binding of divalent cations. Comparison with the 15.5 kDa/Snu13-RNA complex structure suggests why the eukaryotic homolog does not recognize terminal stem loop L7Ae binding sites.},

abstract = {The kink turn (K-turn) is an RNA structural motif found in many biologically significant RNAs. While most examples of the K-turn have a similar fold, the crystal structure of the Azoarcus group I intron revealed a novel RNA conformation, a reverse kink turn bent in the direction opposite that of a consensus K-turn. The reverse K-turn is bent toward the major grooves rather than the minor grooves of the flanking helices, yet the sequence differs from the K-turn consensus by only a single nucleotide. Here we demonstrate that the reverse bend direction is not solely defined by internal sequence elements, but is instead affected by structural elements external to the K-turn. It bends toward the major groove under the direction of a tetraloop-tetraloop receptor. The ability of one sequence to form two distinct structures demonstrates the inherent plasticity of the K-turn sequence. Such plasticity suggests that the K-turn is not a primary element in RNA folding, but instead is shaped by other structural elements within the RNA or ribonucleoprotein assembly.},

abstract = {Multiple sequence alignments are powerful tools for understanding the structures, functions, and evolutionary histories of linear biological macromolecules (DNA, RNA, and proteins), and for finding homologs in sequence databases. We address several ontological issues related to RNA sequence alignments that are informed by structure. Multiple sequence alignments are usually shown as two-dimensional (2D) matrices, with rows representing individual sequences, and columns identifying nucleotides from different sequences that correspond structurally, functionally, and/or evolutionarily. However, the requirement that sequences and structures correspond nucleotide-by-nucleotide is unrealistic and hinders representation of important biological relationships. High-throughput sequencing efforts are also rapidly making 2D alignments unmanageable because of vertical and horizontal expansion as more sequences are added. Solving the shortcomings of traditional RNA sequence alignments requires explicit annotation of the meaning of each relationship within the alignment. We introduce the notion of "correspondence," which is an equivalence relation between RNA elements in sets of sequences as the basis of an RNA alignment ontology. The purpose of this ontology is twofold: first, to enable the development of new representations of RNA data and of software tools that resolve the expansion problems with current RNA sequence alignments, and second, to facilitate the integration of sequence data with secondary and three-dimensional structural information, as well as other experimental information, to create simultaneously more accurate and more exploitable RNA alignments.},

abstract = {The occurrences of two recurrent motifs in ribosomal RNA sequences, the Kink-turn and the C-loop, are examined in crystal structures and systematically compared with sequence alignments of rRNAs from the three kingdoms of life in order to identify the range of the structural and sequence variations. Isostericity Matrices are used to analyze structurally the sequence variations of the characteristic non-Watson-Crick base pairs for each motif. We show that Isostericity Matrices for non-Watson-Crick base pairs provide important tools for deriving the sequence signatures of recurrent motifs, for scoring and refining sequence alignments, and for determining whether motifs are conserved throughout evolution. The systematic use of Isostericity Matrices identifies the positions of the insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides relative to the structurally characterized examples of motifs and, most importantly, specifies whether these changes result in new motifs. Thus, comparative analysis coupled with Isostericity Matrices allows one to produce and refine structural sequence alignments. The analysis, based on both sequence and structure, permits therefore the evaluation of the conservation of motifs across phylogeny and the derivation of rules of equivalence between structural motifs. The conservations observed in Isostericity Matrices form a predictive basis for identifying motifs in sequences.},

We present a method that prevents these systematic errors by recognizing insertions and deletions as distinct evolutionary events. We show theoretically and practically that this improves the quality of sequence alignments and downstream analyses over a wide range of realistic alignment problems. These results suggest that insertions and sequence turnover are more common than is currently thought and challenge the conventional picture of sequence evolution and mechanisms of functional and structural changes.},

These models are of three types: 6-state models include only the four Watson-Crick pairs plus GU and UG; 7-state models include a single mismatch state that combines all of the 10 possible mismatches; 16-state models treat all mismatch states separately. We analyzed a set of eubacterial ribosomal RNA sequences with a well-established phylogenetic tree structure. For each model, the maximum-likelihood values of the parameters were obtained. The models were compared using the Akaike information criterion, the likelihood-ratio test, and Cox's test. With a high significance level, models that permit a nonzero rate of double substitutions performed better than those that assume zero double substitution rate. Some models assume symmetry between GC and CG, between AU and UA, and between GU and UG. Models that relaxed this symmetry assumption performed slightly better, but the tests did not all agree on the significance level. The most general time-reversible model significantly outperformed any of the simplifications. We consider the relative merits of all these models for molecular phylogenetics.},

abstract = {RNAs are modular biomolecules, composed largely of conserved structural subunits, or motifs. These structural motifs comprise the secondary structure of RNA and are knit together via tertiary interactions into a compact, functional, three-dimensional structure and are to be distinguished from motifs defined by sequence or function. A relatively small number of structural motifs are found repeatedly in RNA hairpin and internal loops, and are observed to be composed of a limited number of common 'structural elements'. In addition to secondary and tertiary structure motifs, there are functional motifs specific for certain biological roles and binding motifs that serve to complex metals or other ligands. Research is continuing into the identification and classification of RNA structural motifs and is being initiated to predict motifs from sequence, to trace their phylogenetic relationships and to use them as building blocks in RNA engineering.},

abstract = {RNA motifs can be defined broadly as recurrent structural elements containing multiple intramolecular RNA-RNA interactions, as observed in atomic-resolution RNA structures. They constitute the modular building blocks of RNA architecture, which is organized hierarchically. Recent work has focused on analyzing RNA backbone conformations to identify, define and search for new instances of recurrent motifs in X-ray structures. One current view asserts that recurrent RNA strand segments with characteristic backbone configurations qualify as independent motifs. Other considerations indicate that, to characterize modular motifs, one must take into account the larger structural context of such strand segments. This follows the biologically relevant motivation, which is to identify RNA structural characteristics that are subject to sequence constraints and that thus relate RNA architectures to sequences.},

The growing number of high-resolution structures of ribosomes from different organisms, in free form and in complex with various ligands, provides unique data for structural and comparative analyses of RNA structures. We model the ribosome structure as a network, where nucleotides are represented as nodes and intermolecular interactions as edges. As shown previously for proteins, we found that the major functional sites of the ribosome exhibit significantly high centrality measures. Specifically, we demonstrate that mutations that strongly affect ribosome function and assembly can be distinguished from mild mutations based on their network properties. Furthermore, we observed that closeness centrality of the rRNA nucleotides is highly conserved in the bacteria, suggesting the network representation as a comparative tool for the ribosome analysis. Finally, we suggest a global topology perspective to characterize functional sites and to reveal the unique properties of the ribosome.},

abstract = {RNA molecules are stabilized by a wide range of noncanonical interactions that are not present in DNA. Among them, the recently classified base-phosphate (BPh) interactions belong to the most important ones. Twelve percent of nucleotides in the ribosomal crystal structures are involved in BPh interactions. BPh interactions are highly conserved and provide major constraints on RNA sequence evolution. Here we provide assessment of the energetics of BPh interactions using MP2 computations extrapolated to the complete basis set of atomic orbitals and corrected for higher-order electron correlation effects. The reference computations are compared with DFT-D and DFT-D3 approaches, the SAPT method, and the molecular mechanics force field. The computations, besides providing the basic benchmark for the BPh interactions, allow some refinements of the original classification, including identification of some potential doubly bonded BPh patterns. The reference computations are followed by analysis of some larger RNA fragments that consider the context of the BPh interactions. The computations demonstrate the complexity of interaction patterns utilizing the BPh interactions in real RNA structures. The BPh interactions are often involved in intricate interaction networks. We studied BPh interactions of protonated adenine that can contribute to catalysis of hairpin ribozyme, the key BPh interaction in the S-turn motif of the sarcin-ricin loop, which may predetermine the S-turn topology and complex BPh patterns from the glmS riboswitch. Finally, the structural stability of BPh interactions in explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations is assessed. The simulations well preserve key BPh interactions and allow dissection of structurally/functionally important water-meditated BPh bridges, which could not be considered in earlier bioinformatics classification of BPh interactions.},

In eukaryotic cells, tRNAs are actively transported from their site of synthesis in the nucleus to their site of function in the cytosol. This is mediated by a dedicated nucleo-cytoplasmic transport factor of the karyopherin-beta family (Xpot, also known as Los1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Here we report the 3.2 A resolution structure of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Xpot in complex with tRNA and RanGTP, and the 3.1 A structure of unbound Xpot, revealing both nuclear and cytosolic snapshots of this transport factor. Xpot undergoes a large conformational change on binding cargo, wrapping around the tRNA and, in particular, binding to the tRNA 5' and 3' ends. The binding mode explains how Xpot can recognize all mature tRNAs in the cell and yet distinguish them from those that have not been properly processed, thus coupling tRNA export to quality control.},

Previous tools fall short of this goal. RESULTS: CMfinder is a new tool to predict RNA motifs in unaligned sequences. It is an expectation maximization algorithm using covariance models for motif description, featuring novel integration of multiple techniques for effective search of motif space, and a Bayesian framework that blends mutual information-based and folding energy-based approaches to predict structure in a principled way. Extensive tests show that our method works well on datasets with either low or high sequence similarity, is robust to inclusion of lengthy extraneous flanking sequence and/or completely unrelated sequences, and is reasonably fast and scalable. In testing on 19 known ncRNA families, including some difficult cases with poor sequence conservation and large indels, our method demonstrates excellent average per-base-pair accuracy--79\% compared with at most 60\% for alternative methods. More importantly, the resulting probabilistic model can be directly used for homology search, allowing iterative refinement of structural models based on additional homologs. We have used this approach to obtain highly accurate covariance models of known RNA motifs based on small numbers of related sequences, which identified homologs in deeply-diverged species.},

Hydrogen added models of isolated base pairs, with heavy atoms frozen in their 'away from equilibrium' geometries, built from coordinates extracted from NDB, were geometry optimized using HF/6-31G** basis set, both before and after unfreezing the heavy atoms. Interaction energies, including BSSE and deformation energy corrections, were calculated, compared with respective single point MP2 energies, and correlated with occurrence frequencies and with types and geometries of hydrogen bonding interactions. Systems having two or more N-H...O/N hydrogen bonds had reasonable interaction energies which correlated well with respective occurrence frequencies and highlighted the possibility of some of them playing important roles in improved secondary structure prediction methods. Several of the remaining base pairs with one N-H...O/N and/or one C-H...O/N interactions respectively, had poor interaction energies and negligible occurrences. High geometry variations on optimization of some of these were suggestive of their conformational switch like characteristics.},

These basepairs are classified according to their tertiary interactions, and sequence conservation at their positions is determined. G/U basepairs participating in tertiary interactions are more conserved than those lacking any interactions. Specific interactions occurring in the G/U shallow groove pocket--like packing interactions (P-interactions) and some phosphate backbone interactions (phosphate-in-pocket interactions)--lead to higher G/U conservation than others. Two salient cases of unique phylogenetic compensation are discovered. First, a P-interaction is conserved through a series of compensatory mutations involving all four participating nucleotides to preserve or restore the G/U in the optimal orientation. Second, a G/U basepair forming a P-interaction and another one forming a phosphate-in-pocket interaction are replaced by GNRA loops that maintain similar tertiary contacts. MD simulations were carried out on eight P-interactions. The specific GU/CG signature of this interaction observed in structure and sequence analysis was rationalized, and can now be used for improving sequence alignments.},

Here, we introduce a quantitative measure of base pair isostericity, the IsoDiscrepancy Index (IDI), to more accurately determine which base pair substitutions can potentially occur in conserved motifs. We extract and classify base pairs from a reduced-redundancy set of RNA 3D structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and calculate centroids (exemplars) for each base combination and geometric base pair type (family). We use the exemplars and IDI values to update our online Basepair Catalog and the Isostericity Matrices (IM) for each base pair family. From the database of base pairs observed in 3D structures we derive base pair occurrence frequencies for each of the 12 geometric base pair families. In order to improve the statistics from the 3D structures, we also derive base pair occurrence frequencies from rRNA sequence alignments.},

R3D-BLAST takes as input an RNA 3D structure in the PDB format and outputs all substructures of the hits similar to that of the query with a graphical display to show their structural superposition.

abstract = {Structured RNAs achieve their active states by traversing complex, multidimensional energetic landscapes. Here we probe the folding landscape of the Tetrahymena ribozyme by using a powerful approach: the folding of single ribozyme molecules is followed beginning from distinct regions of the folding landscape. The experiments, combined with small-angle x-ray scattering results, show that the landscape contains discrete folding pathways. These pathways are separated by large free-energy barriers that prevent interconversion between them, indicating that the pathways lie in deep channels in the folding landscape. Chemical protection and mutagenesis experiments are then used to elucidate the structural features that determine which folding pathway is followed. Strikingly, a specific long-range tertiary contact can either help folding or hinder folding, depending on when it is formed during the process. Together these results provide an unprecedented view of the topology of an RNA folding landscape and the RNA structural features that underlie this multidimensional landscape.},

The kinked conformation is stabilized by metal ions, or the binding of proteins including L7Ae. We now demonstrate a third mechanism for the stabilization of k-turn structure, involving tertiary interactions within a larger RNA structure. The SAM-I riboswitch contains an essential standard k-turn sequence that kinks a helix so that its terminal loop can make a long-range interaction. We find that some sequence variations in the k-turn within the riboswitch do not prevent SAM binding, despite preventing the folding of the k-turn in isolation. Furthermore, two crystal structures show that the sequence-variant k-turns are conventionally folded within the riboswitch. This study shows that the folded structure of the k-turn can be stabilized by tertiary interactions within a larger RNA structure.},

Individual 2'-OH groups have been removed by chemical synthesis, and the kinking of the RNA has been studied by gel electrophoresis and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The results have been analyzed by reference to a database of 11 different crystallographic structures of K-turns. The potential hydrogen bonds fall into several classes. The most important are those in the core of the turn and ribose-phosphate interactions around the bulge. Of these the single most important hydrogen bond is one donated from the 2'-OH of the 5' nucleotide of the bulge to the N1 of the adenine of the kink-proximal A*G pair. This is present in all known K-turn structures, and removal of the 2'-OH completely prevents metal ion-induced folding. Hydrogen bonds formed in the minor grooves of the helical stems are less important, and removal of the participating 2'-OH groups leads to reduced impairment of folding. These interactions are generally more polymorphic, and hydrogen bonds probably form where possible, as permitted by the global structure.},

We found that secondary structures evolve both by whole stem insertion/deletion, and by mutations that create or disrupt stem base pairing. We analyzed the evolution of stem lengths and constructed substitution matrices describing the changes responsible for the variation in the RNA stem length. In addition, we used principal component analysis of the stem length data to determine the most variable stems in different families of RNA. This data provides new insights into the evolution of RNA secondary structures and patterns of variation in the lengths of double helical regions of RNA molecules. Our findings will facilitate design of improved mutational models for RNA structure evolution.},

abstract = {Existing computational methods for RNA secondary-structure prediction tacitly assume RNA to only encode functional RNA structures. However, experimental studies have revealed that some RNA sequences, e.g. compact viral genomes, can simultaneously encode functional RNA structures as well as proteins, and evidence is accumulating that this phenomenon may also be found in Eukaryotes. We here present the first comparative method, called RNA-DECODER, which explicitly takes the known protein-coding context of an RNA-sequence alignment into account in order to predict evolutionarily conserved secondary-structure elements, which may span both coding and non-coding regions. RNA-DECODER employs a stochastic context-free grammar together with a set of carefully devised phylogenetic substitution-models, which can disentangle and evaluate the different kinds of overlapping evolutionary constraints which arise. We show that RNA-DECODER's parameters can be automatically trained to successfully fold known secondary structures within the HCV genome. We scan the genomes of HCV and polio virus for conserved secondary-structure elements, and analyze performance as a function of available evolutionary information. On known secondary structures, RNA-DECODER shows a sensitivity similar to the programs MFOLD, PFOLD and RNAALIFOLD. When scanning the entire genomes of HCV and polio virus for structure elements, RNA-DECODER's results indicate a markedly higher specificity than MFOLD, PFOLD and RNAALIFOLD.},

abstract = {The occurrences of two recurrent motifs in ribosomal RNA sequences, the Kink-turn and the C-loop, are examined in crystal structures and systematically compared with sequence alignments of rRNAs from the three kingdoms of life in order to identify the range of the structural and sequence variations. Isostericity Matrices are used to analyze structurally the sequence variations of the characteristic non-Watson-Crick base pairs for each motif. We show that Isostericity Matrices for non-Watson-Crick base pairs provide important tools for deriving the sequence signatures of recurrent motifs, for scoring and refining sequence alignments, and for determining whether motifs are conserved throughout evolution. The systematic use of Isostericity Matrices identifies the positions of the insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides relative to the structurally characterized examples of motifs and, most importantly, specifies whether these changes result in new motifs. Thus, comparative analysis coupled with Isostericity Matrices allows one to produce and refine structural sequence alignments. The analysis, based on both sequence and structure, permits therefore the evaluation of the conservation of motifs across phylogeny and the derivation of rules of equivalence between structural motifs. The conservations observed in Isostericity Matrices form a predictive basis for identifying motifs in sequences.},

abstract = {Model-based phylogenetic reconstruction methods traditionally assume homogeneity of nucleotide frequencies among sequence sites and lineages. Yet, heterogeneity in base composition is a characteristic shared by most biological sequences. Compositional variation in time, reflected in the compositional biases among contemporary sequences, has already been extensively studied, and its detrimental effects on phylogenetic estimates are known. However, fewer studies have focused on the effects of spatial compositional heterogeneity within genes. We show here that different sites in an alignment do not always share a unique compositional pattern, and we provide examples where nucleotide frequency trends are correlated with the site-specific rate of evolution in RNA genes. Spatial compositional heterogeneity is shown to affect the estimation of evolutionary parameters. With standard phylogenetic methods, estimates of equilibrium frequencies are found to be biased towards the composition observed at fast-evolving sites. Conversely, the ancestral composition estimates of some time-heterogeneous but spatially homogeneous methods are found to be biased towards frequencies observed at invariant and slow-evolving sites. The latter finding challenges the result of a previous study arguing against a hyperthermophilic last universal ancestor from the low apparent G + C content of its rRNA sequences. We propose a new model to account for compositional variation across sites. A Gaussian process prior is used to allow for a smooth change in composition with evolutionary rate. The model has been implemented in the phylogenetic inference software PHASE, and Bayesian methods can be used to obtain the model parameters. The results suggest that this model can accurately capture the observed trends in present-day RNA sequences.},

We show that considerable heterogeneity exists in the relative rates of evolution of different secondary structure categories (stems, loops, bulges, etc.) within the rRNA, and that in eukaryotes, loops actually evolve much faster than stems. Both rates of evolution and abundance of different structural categories vary with distance from functionally important parts of the ribosome such as the tRNA path and the peptidyl transferase center. For example, fast-evolving residues are mainly found at the surface; stems are enriched at the subunit interface, and junctions near the peptidyl transferase center. However, different secondary structure categories evolve at different rates even when these effects are accounted for. The results demonstrate that relative rates and patterns of evolution are lineage specific, suggesting that phylogenetically and structurally specific models will improve evolutionary and structural predictions.},

abstract = {With the availability of genome-wide transcription data and massive comparative sequencing, the discrimination of coding from noncoding RNAs and the assessment of coding potential in evolutionarily conserved regions arose as a core analysis task. Here we present RNAcode, a program to detect coding regions in multiple sequence alignments that is optimized for emerging applications not covered by current protein gene-finding software. Our algorithm combines information from nucleotide substitution and gap patterns in a unified framework and also deals with real-life issues such as alignment and sequencing errors. It uses an explicit statistical model with no machine learning component and can therefore be applied "out of the box," without any training, to data from all domains of life. We describe the RNAcode method and apply it in combination with mass spectrometry experiments to predict and confirm seven novel short peptides in Escherichia coli and to analyze the coding potential of RNAs previously annotated as "noncoding." RNAcode is open source software and available for all major platforms at http://wash.github.com/rnacode.},

abstract = {When searching sequence databases for RNAs, it is desirable to score both primary sequence and RNA secondary structure similarity. Covariance models (CMs) are probabilistic models well-suited for RNA similarity search applications. However, the computational complexity of CM dynamic programming alignment algorithms has limited their practical application. Here we describe an acceleration method called query-dependent banding (QDB), which uses the probabilistic query CM to precalculate regions of the dynamic programming lattice that have negligible probability, independently of the target database. We have implemented QDB in the freely available Infernal software package. QDB reduces the average case time complexity of CM alignment from LN(2.4) to LN(1.3) for a query RNA of N residues and a target database of L residues, resulting in a 4-fold speedup for typical RNA queries. Combined with other improvements to Infernal, including informative mixture Dirichlet priors on model parameters, benchmarks also show increased sensitivity and specificity resulting from improved parameterization.},

abstract = {Although functional RNA molecules are known to be biased in overall composition, the effects of background composition on the probability of finding a particular active site by chance has received little attention. The probability of finding a particular motif has important implications both for understanding the distribution of functional RNAs in ancient and modern organisms with varying genome compositions and for tuning SELEX pools to optimize the chance of finding specific functions. Here we develop a new method for calculating the probability of finding a modular motif containing base-paired regions, and use a computational grid to fold several hundred million random RNA sequences containing the core elements of the isoleucine aptamer and the hammerhead ribozyme to estimate the probability that a sequence containing these structural elements will fold correctly when isolated from background sequences of different compositions. We find that the two motifs are most likely to be found in distinct regions of compositional space, and that the regions of greatest abundance are influenced by the probability of finding the conserved bases, finding the flanking helices, and folding, in that order of importance. Additionally, we can refine our estimates of the number of random sequences required for a 50\% probability of finding an example of each site in unbiased random pools of length 100 to 4.1 x 10(9) for the isoleucine aptamer and 1.6 x 10(10) for the hammerhead ribozyme. These figures are consistent with the facile recovery of these motifs from SELEX experiments.},

Important examples are found in the ribosome, U4 RNA, and in snoRNAs involved in RNA modification. The motif is a common protein binding site, and the RNA has been found to adopt a tightly kinked conformation in crystal structures. However, in free solution there is a dynamic exchange between kinked and extended conformations, with the equilibrium driven toward the kinked form by the addition of metal ions. Here we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to show that the L7Ae protein of Archaeoglobus fulgidus binds to RNA containing a kink-turn with nanomolar affinity, and induces folding into the tightly kinked conformation even in the absence of metal ions. Thus this RNA may act as a relatively flexible hinge during RNA folding, until fixed into its ultimate kinked structure by the binding of L7 or related protein.},

abstract = {Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are receiving more and more attention not only as an abundant class of genes, but also as regulatory structural elements (some located in mRNAs). A key feature of RNA function is its structure. Computational methods were developed early for folding and prediction of RNA structure with the aim of assisting in functional analysis. With the discovery of more and more ncRNAs, it has become clear that a large fraction of these are highly structured. Interestingly, a large part of the structure is comprised of regular Watson-Crick and GU wobble base pairs. This and the increased amount of available genomes have made it possible to employ structure-based methods for genomic screens. The field has moved from folding prediction of single sequences to computational screens for ncRNAs in genomic sequence using the RNA structure as the main characteristic feature. Whereas early methods focused on energy-directed folding of single sequences, comparative analysis based on structure preserving changes of base pairs has been efficient in improving accuracy, and today this constitutes a key component in genomic screens. Here, we cover the basic principles of RNA folding and touch upon some of the concepts in current methods that have been applied in genomic screens for de novo RNA structures in searches for novel ncRNA genes and regulatory RNA structure on mRNAs. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the different strategies and how they can complement each other.},

abstract = {Analyzing a single data set using multiple RNA informatics programs often requires a file format conversion between each pair of programs, significantly hampering productivity. To facilitate the interoperation of these programs, we propose a syntax to exchange basic RNA molecular information. This RNAML syntax allows for the storage and the exchange of information about RNA sequence and secondary and tertiary structures. The syntax permits the description of higher level information about the data including, but not restricted to, base pairs, base triples, and pseudoknots. A class-oriented approach allows us to represent data common to a given set of RNA molecules, such as a sequence alignment and a consensus secondary structure. Documentation about experiments and computations, as well as references to journals and external databases, are included in the syntax. The chief challenge in creating such a syntax was to determine the appropriate scope of usage and to ensure extensibility as new needs will arise. The syntax complies with the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) recommendations, a widely accepted standard for syntax specifications. In addition to the various generic packages that exist to read and interpret XML formats, an XML processor was developed and put in the open-source MC-Core library for nucleic acid and protein structure computer manipulation.},

Since the structural features of RNA are of major importance to their biological function, there is much interest in predicting RNA structure, either in free form or in interaction with various ligands, including proteins, metabolites and other molecules. In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have developed novel RNA algorithms for predicting RNA secondary and tertiary structures. In this review, we describe current experimental and computational advances and discuss recent ideas that are transforming the traditional view of RNA folding. To evaluate the performance of the most recent RNA 3D folding algorithms, we provide a comparative study in order to test the performance of available 3D structure prediction algorithms for an RNA data set of 43 structures of various lengths and motifs. We find that the algorithms vary widely in terms of prediction quality across different RNA lengths and topologies; most predictions have very large root mean square deviations from the experimental structure. We conclude by outlining some suggestions for future RNA folding research.},

The rapidly growing number of three-dimensional RNA structures at atomic resolution requires that databases contain the annotation of such base pairs. An unambiguous and descriptive nomenclature was proposed recently in which RNA base pairs were classified by the base edges participating in the interaction (Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen/CH or sugar edge) and the orientation of the glycosidic bonds relative to the hydrogen bonds (cis or trans). Twelve basic geometric families were identified and all 12 have been observed in crystal structures. For each base pairing family, we present here the 4 x 4 'isostericity matrices' summarizing the geometric relationships between the 16 pairwise combinations of the four standard bases, A, C, G and U. Whenever available, a representative example of each observed base pair from X-ray crystal structures (3.0 A resolution or better) is provided or, otherwise, theoretically plausible models. This format makes apparent the recurrent geometric patterns that are observed and helps identify isosteric pairs that co-vary or interchange in sequences of homologous molecules while maintaining conserved three-dimensional motifs.},

Thus, enriching in vitro selection pools with complex structures could increase the probability of discovering novel RNAs. Here we develop an approach for engineering sequence pools that links RNA sequence space regions with corresponding structural distributions via a "mixing matrix" approach combined with a graph theory analysis. We define five classes of mixing matrices motivated by covariance mutations in RNA; these constructs define nucleotide transition rates and are applied to chosen starting sequences to yield specific nonrandom pools. We examine the coverage of sequence space as a function of the mixing matrix and starting sequence via clustering analysis. We show that, in contrast to random sequences, which are associated only with a local region of sequence space, our designed pools, including a structured pool for GTP aptamers, can target specific motifs. It follows that experimental synthesis of designed pools can benefit from using optimized starting sequences, mixing matrices, and pool fractions associated with each of our constructed pools as a guide. Automation of our approach could provide practical tools for pool design applications for in vitro selection of RNAs and related problems.},

A 10-bp periodicity was prevalent in hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaebacteria, and an 11-bp periodicity was prevalent in eubacteria. The 10-bp periodicity was also prevalent in the eukaryotes such as the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Additionally, in the worm genome, a 68-bp periodicity in chromosome I, a 59-bp periodicity in chromosome II, and a 94-bp periodicity in chromosome III were found. In human chromosomes 21 and 22, approximately 167- or 84-bp periodicity was detected along the entire length of these chromosomes. Because the 167-bp is identical to the length of DNA that forms two complete helical turns in nucleosome organization, we speculated that the respective sequences may correspond to arrays of a special compact form of nucleosomes clustered in specific regions of the human chromosomes.

abstract = {By conventional wisdom, a feature that occurs too often or too rarely in a genome can indicate a functional element. To infer functionality from frequency, it is crucial to precisely characterize occurrences in randomly evolving DNA. We find that the frequency of oligonucleotides in a genomic sequence follows primarily a Pareto-lognormal distribution, which encapsulates lognormal and power-law features found across all known genomes. Such a distribution could be the result of completely random evolution by a copying process. Our characterization of the entire frequency distribution of genomic words opens a way to a more accurate reasoning about their over- and underrepresentation in genomic sequences.},

abstract = {We report an efficient method for detecting functional RNAs. The approach, which combines comparative sequence analysis and structure prediction, already has yielded excellent results for a small number of aligned sequences and is suitable for large-scale genomic screens. It consists of two basic components: (i) a measure for RNA secondary structure conservation based on computing a consensus secondary structure, and (ii) a measure for thermodynamic stability, which, in the spirit of a z score, is normalized with respect to both sequence length and base composition but can be calculated without sampling from shuffled sequences. Functional RNA secondary structures can be identified in multiple sequence alignments with high sensitivity and high specificity. We demonstrate that this approach is not only much more accurate than previous methods but also significantly faster. The method is implemented in the program rnaz, which can be downloaded from www.tbi.univie.ac.at/\~{}wash/RNAz. We screened all alignments of length n > or = 50 in the Comparative Regulatory Genomics database, which compiles conserved noncoding elements in upstream regions of orthologous genes from human, mouse, rat, Fugu, and zebrafish. We recovered all of the known noncoding RNAs and cis-acting elements with high significance and found compelling evidence for many other conserved RNA secondary structures not described so far to our knowledge.},

In parallel to this line of study, studies in population genetics and phenomenological molecular evolution established a mathematical framework to describe the changes in genome sequences in populations of organisms over time.

Here, we describe an RNA knowledge base (RKB) for structure-based knowledge using RDF/OWL Semantic Web technologies. RKB extends a number of ontologies and contains basic terminology for nucleic acid composition along with context/model-specific structural features such as sugar conformations, base pairings and base stackings. RKB (available at http://semanticscience.org/projects/rkb) is populated with PDB entries and MC-Annotate structural annotation. We show queries to the RKB using description logic reasoning, thus opening the door to question answering over independently-published RNA knowledge using Semantic Web technologies.},

abstract = {RNA tertiary motifs play an important role in RNA folding and biochemical functions. To help interpret the complex organization of RNA tertiary interactions, we comprehensively analyze a data set of 54 high-resolution RNA crystal structures for motif occurrence and correlations. Specifically, we search seven recognized categories of RNA tertiary motifs (coaxial helix, A-minor, ribose zipper, pseudoknot, kissing hairpin, tRNA D-loop/T-loop, and tetraloop-tetraloop receptor) by various computer programs. For the nonredundant RNA data set, we find 613 RNA tertiary interactions, most of which occur in the 16S and 23S rRNAs. An analysis of these motifs reveals the diversity and variety of A-minor motif interactions and the various possible loop-loop receptor interactions that expand upon the tetraloop-tetraloop receptor. Correlations between motifs, such as pseudoknot or coaxial helix with A-minor, reveal higher-order patterns. These findings may ultimately help define tertiary structure restraints for RNA tertiary structure prediction. A complete annotation of the RNA diagrams for our data set is available at http://www.biomath.nyu.edu/motifs/.},

Ribosome assembly is subject to intricate regulatory control and is aided by a multitude of assembly factors in vivo, but can also be carried out in vitro. The details of the assembly process remain unknown even in the face of atomic structures of the entire ribosome and after more than three decades of research. Some of the earliest research on ribosome assembly produced the Nomura assembly map of the small subunit, revealing a hierarchy of protein binding dependencies for the 20 proteins involved and suggesting the possibility of a single intermediate. Recent work using a combination of RNA footprinting and pulse-chase quantitative mass spectrometry paints a picture of small subunit assembly as a dynamic and varied landscape, with sequential and hierarchical RNA folding and protein binding events finally converging on complete subunits. Proteins generally lock tightly into place in a 5' to 3' direction along the ribosomal RNA, stabilizing transient RNA conformations, while RNA folding and the early stages of protein binding are initiated from multiple locations along the length of the RNA.},

abstract = {RNAs must fold into unique three-dimensional structures to function in the cell, but how each polynucleotide finds its native structure is not understood. To investigate whether the stability of the tertiary structure determines the speed and accuracy of RNA folding, docking of a tetraloop with its receptor in a bacterial group I ribozyme was perturbed by site-directed mutagenesis. Disruption of the tetraloop or its receptor destabilizes tertiary interactions throughout the ribozyme by 2-3 kcal/mol, demonstrating that tertiary interactions form cooperatively in the transition from a native-like intermediate to the native state. Nondenaturing PAGE and RNase T1 digestion showed that base pairs form less homogeneously in the mutant RNAs during the transition from the unfolded state to the intermediate. Thus, tertiary interactions between helices bias the ensemble of secondary structures toward native-like conformations. Time-resolved hydroxyl radical footprinting showed that the wild-type ribozyme folds completely within 5-20 ms. By contrast, only 40-60\% of a tetraloop mutant ribozyme folds in 30-40 ms, with the remainder folding in 30-200 s via nonnative intermediates. Therefore, destabilization of tetraloop-receptor docking introduces an alternate folding pathway in the otherwise smooth energy landscape of the wild-type ribozyme. Our results show that stable tertiary structure increases the flux through folding pathways that lead directly and rapidly to the native structure.},

The source of sufficiently accurate structural data for these purposes is atomic-resolution X-ray structures of RNA nucleotides, oligonucleotides, and biologically functional RNA molecules. All of our basic knowledge of bond lengths, angles, and stereochemistry in RNA nucleotides, as well as their interaction preferences, including all types of base-pairing, base-stacking, and base-backbone interactions, is ultimately extracted from X-ray structures. One key requirement for reference databases intended for knowledge extraction is the nonredundancy of the structures that are included in the analysis, to avoid bias in the deduced frequency parameters. Here, we address this issue and detail how we produce, on a largely automated and ongoing basis, nonredundant lists of atomic-resolution structures at different resolution thresholds for use in knowledge-driven RNA applications. The file collections are available for download at http://rna.bgsu.edu/nrlist. The primary lists that we provide only include X-ray structures, organized by resolution thresholds, but for completeness, we also provide separate lists that include structures solved by NMR or cryo-EM.},

abstract = {A novel method is presented for joint prediction of alignment and common secondary structures of two RNA sequences. The joint consideration of common secondary structures and alignment is accomplished by structural alignment over a search space defined by the newly introduced motif called matched helical regions. The matched helical region formulation generalizes previously employed constraints for structural alignment and thereby better accommodates the structural variability within RNA families. A probabilistic model based on pseudo free energies obtained from precomputed base pairing and alignment probabilities is utilized for scoring structural alignments. Maximum a posteriori (MAP) common secondary structures, sequence alignment and joint posterior probabilities of base pairing are obtained from the model via a dynamic programming algorithm called PARTS. The advantage of the more general structural alignment of PARTS is seen in secondary structure predictions for the RNase P family. For this family, the PARTS MAP predictions of secondary structures and alignment perform significantly better than prior methods that utilize a more restrictive structural alignment model. For the tRNA and 5S rRNA families, the richer structural alignment model of PARTS does not offer a benefit and the method therefore performs comparably with existing alternatives. For all RNA families studied, the posterior probability estimates obtained from PARTS offer an improvement over posterior probability estimates from a single sequence prediction. When considering the base pairings predicted over a threshold value of confidence, the combination of sensitivity and positive predictive value is superior for PARTS than for the single sequence prediction. PARTS source code is available for download under the GNU public license at http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu.},

abstract = {Thermodynamic folding algorithms and structure probing experiments are commonly used to determine the secondary structure of RNAs. Here we propose a formal framework to reconcile information from both prediction algorithms and probing experiments. The thermodynamic energy parameters are adjusted using 'pseudo-energies' to minimize the discrepancy between prediction and experiment. Our framework differs from related approaches that used pseudo-energies in several key aspects. (i) The energy model is only changed when necessary and no adjustments are made if prediction and experiment are consistent. (ii) Pseudo-energies remain biophysically interpretable and hold positional information where experiment and model disagree. (iii) The whole thermodynamic ensemble of structures is considered thus allowing to reconstruct mixtures of suboptimal structures from seemingly contradicting data. (iv) The noise of the energy model and the experimental data is explicitly modeled leading to an intuitive weighting factor through which the problem can be seen as folding with 'soft' constraints of different strength. We present an efficient algorithm to iteratively calculate pseudo-energies within this framework and demonstrate how this approach can be used in combination with SHAPE chemical probing data to improve secondary structure prediction. We further demonstrate that the pseudo-energies correlate with biophysical effects that are known to affect RNA folding such as chemical nucleotide modifications and protein binding.},

The dynamic and structural nature of RNAs presents a whole new set of informatics challenges to the computational community. The ability to relate structure and dynamics to function will be key to understanding this complex world.

A crucial next step in understanding translation is to reveal the functional significance of the large-scale motions implied by static ribosome structures. This requires determining the trajectories, timescales, forces, and biochemical signals that underlie these dynamic conformational changes. Single-molecule methods have emerged as important tools for the characterization of motion in complex systems, including translation. In this review, we chronicle the key discoveries in this nascent field, which have demonstrated the power and promise of single-molecule techniques in the study of translation.},

@article{Knies2008,
abstract = {There is growing evidence that interactions between biological molecules (e.g., RNA-RNA, protein-protein, RNA-protein) place limits on the rate and trajectory of molecular evolution. Here, by extending Kimura's model of compensatory evolution at interacting sites, we show that the ratio of transition to transversion substitutions (kappa) at interacting sites should be equal to the square of the ratio at independent sites. Because transition mutations generally occur at a higher rate than transversions, the model predicts that kappa should be higher at interacting sites than at independent sites. We tested this prediction in 10 RNA secondary structures by comparing phylogenetically derived estimates of kappa in paired sites within stems (kappa(p)) and unpaired sites within loops (kappa(u)). Eight of the 10 structures showed an excellent match to the quantitative predictions of the model, and 9 of the 10 structures matched the qualitative prediction kappa(p) > kappa(u). Only the Rev response element from the human immunovirus (HIV) genome showed the reverse pattern, with kappa(p) < kappa(u). Although a variety of evolutionary forces could produce quantitative deviations from the model predictions, the reversal in magnitude of kappa(p) and kappa(u) could be achieved only by violating the model assumption that the underlying transition (or transversion) mutation rates were identical in paired and unpaired regions of the molecule. We explore the ability of the APOBEC3 enzymes, host defense mechanisms against retroviruses, which induce transition mutations preferentially in single-stranded regions of the HIV genome, to explain this exception to the rule. Taken as a whole, our findings suggest that kappa may have utility as a simple diagnostic to evaluate proposed secondary structures.},

abstract = {The prediction of protein structure from sequence remains a major unsolved problem in biology. The most successful protein structure prediction methods make use of a divide-and-conquer strategy to attack the problem: a conformational sampling method generates plausible candidate structures, which are subsequently accepted or rejected using an energy function. Conceptually, this often corresponds to separating local structural bias from the long-range interactions that stabilize the compact, native state. However, sampling protein conformations that are compatible with the local structural bias encoded in a given protein sequence is a long-standing open problem, especially in continuous space. We describe an elegant and mathematically rigorous method to do this, and show that it readily generates native-like protein conformations simply by enforcing compactness. Our results have far-reaching implications for protein structure prediction, determination, simulation, and design.},

abstract = {A probabilistic graphical model is proposed in order to detect the coevolution between different sites in biological sequences. The model extends the continuous-time Markov process of sequence substitution for single nucleic or amino acids and imposes general constraints regarding simultaneous changes on the substitution rate matrix. Given a multiple sequence alignment for each molecule of interest and a phylogenetic tree, the model can predict potential interactions within or between nucleic acids and proteins. Initial validation of the model is carried out using tRNA and 16S rRNA sequence data. The model accurately identifies the secondary interactions of tRNA as well as several known tertiary interactions. In addition, results on 16S rRNA data indicate this general and simple coevolutionary model outperforms several other parametric and nonparametric methods in predicting secondary interactions. Furthermore, the majority of the putative predictions exhibit either direct contact or proximity of the nucleotide pairs in the 3-dimensional structure of the Thermus thermophilus ribosomal small subunit. The results on RNA data suggest a general model of coevolution might be applied to other types of interactions between protein, DNA, and RNA molecules.},

We analyzed a set of eubacterial ribosomal RNA sequences with a well-established phylogenetic tree structure. For each model, the maximum-likelihood values of the parameters were obtained. The models were compared using the Akaike information criterion, the likelihood-ratio test, and Cox's test. With a high significance level, models that permit a nonzero rate of double substitutions performed better than those that assume zero double substitution rate. Some models assume symmetry between GC and CG, between AU and UA, and between GU and UG. Models that relaxed this symmetry assumption performed slightly better, but the tests did not all agree on the significance level. The most general time-reversible model significantly outperformed any of the simplifications. We consider the relative merits of all these models for molecular phylogenetics.},

abstract = {A new computer program to annotate DNA and RNA three-dimensional structures, MC-Annotate, is introduced. The goals of annotation are to efficiently extract and manipulate structural information, to simplify further structural analyses and searches, and to objectively represent structural knowledge. The input of MC-Annotate is a PDB formatted DNA or RNA three-dimensional structure. The output of MC-Annotate is composed of a structural graph that contains the annotations, and a series of HTML documents, one for each nucleotide conformation and base-base interaction present in the input structure. The atomic coordinates of all nucleotides and the homogeneous transformation matrices of all base-base interactions are stored in the structural graph. Symbolic classifications of nucleotide conformations, using sugar puckering modes and nitrogen base orientations around the glycosyl bond, and base-base interactions, using stacking and hydrogen bonding information, are introduced. Peculiarity factors of nucleotide conformations and base-base interactions are defined to indicate their marginalities with all other examples. The peculiarity factors allow us to identify irregular regions and possible stereochemical errors in 3-D structures without interactive visualization. The annotations attached to each nucleotide conformation include its class, its torsion angles, a distribution of the root-mean-square deviations with examples of the same class, the list of examples of the same class, and its peculiarity value. The annotations attached to each base-base interaction include its class, a distribution of distances with examples of the same class, the list of examples of the same class, and its peculiarity value. The distance between two homogeneous transformation matrices is evaluated using a new metric that distinguishes between the rotation and the translation of a transformation matrix in the context of nitrogen bases. MC-Annotate was used to build databases of nucleotide conformations and base-base interactions. It was applied to the ribosomal RNA fragment that binds to protein L11, which annotations revealed peculiar nucleotide conformations and base-base interactions in the regions where the RNA contacts the protein. The question of whether the current database of RNA three-dimensional structures is complete is addressed.},

@article{Knies2008a,
abstract = {There is growing evidence that interactions between biological molecules (e.g., RNA-RNA, protein-protein, RNA-protein) place limits on the rate and trajectory of molecular evolution. Here, by extending Kimura's model of compensatory evolution at interacting sites, we show that the ratio of transition to transversion substitutions (kappa) at interacting sites should be equal to the square of the ratio at independent sites. Because transition mutations generally occur at a higher rate than transversions, the model predicts that kappa should be higher at interacting sites than at independent sites. We tested this prediction in 10 RNA secondary structures by comparing phylogenetically derived estimates of kappa in paired sites within stems (kappa(p)) and unpaired sites within loops (kappa(u)). Eight of the 10 structures showed an excellent match to the quantitative predictions of the model, and 9 of the 10 structures matched the qualitative prediction kappa(p) > kappa(u). Only the Rev response element from the human immunovirus (HIV) genome showed the reverse pattern, with kappa(p) < kappa(u). Although a variety of evolutionary forces could produce quantitative deviations from the model predictions, the reversal in magnitude of kappa(p) and kappa(u) could be achieved only by violating the model assumption that the underlying transition (or transversion) mutation rates were identical in paired and unpaired regions of the molecule. We explore the ability of the APOBEC3 enzymes, host defense mechanisms against retroviruses, which induce transition mutations preferentially in single-stranded regions of the HIV genome, to explain this exception to the rule. Taken as a whole, our findings suggest that kappa may have utility as a simple diagnostic to evaluate proposed secondary structures.},

abstract = {The discoveries of microRNAs and riboswitches, among others, have shown functional RNAs to be biologically more important and genomically more prevalent than previously anticipated. We have developed a general comparative genomics method based on phylogenetic stochastic context-free grammars for identifying functional RNAs encoded in the human genome and used it to survey an eight-way genome-wide alignment of the human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, zebra-fish, and puffer-fish genomes for deeply conserved functional RNAs. At a loose threshold for acceptance, this search resulted in a set of 48,479 candidate RNA structures. This screen finds a large number of known functional RNAs, including 195 miRNAs, 62 histone 3'UTR stem loops, and various types of known genetic recoding elements. Among the highest-scoring new predictions are 169 new miRNA candidates, as well as new candidate selenocysteine insertion sites, RNA editing hairpins, RNAs involved in transcript auto regulation, and many folds that form singletons or small functional RNA families of completely unknown function. While the rate of false positives in the overall set is difficult to estimate and is likely to be substantial, the results nevertheless provide evidence for many new human functional RNAs and present specific predictions to facilitate their further characterization.},

abstract = {There is a fast growing interest in noncoding RNA transcripts. These transcripts are not translated into proteins, but play essential roles in many cellular and pathological processes. Recent efforts toward comprehension of their function has led to a substantial increase in both the number and the size of solved RNA structures. With the aim of addressing questions relating to RNA structural diversity, we examined RNA conservation at three structural levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary structure. Additionally, we developed an automated method for classifying RNA structures based on spatial (three-dimensional [3D]) similarity. Applying the method to all solved RNA structures resulted in a classified database of RNA tertiary structures (DARTS). DARTS embodies 1333 solved RNA structures classified into 94 clusters. The classification is hierarchical, reflecting the structural relationship between and within clusters. We also developed an application for searching DARTS with a new structure. The search is fast and its performance was successfully tested on all solved RNA structures since the creation of DARTS. A user-friendly interface for both the database and the search application is available online. We show intracluster and intercluster similarities in DARTS and demonstrate the usefulness of the search application. The analysis reveals the current structural repertoire of RNA and exposes common global folds and local tertiary motifs. Further study of these conserved substructures may suggest possible RNA domains and building blocks. This should be beneficial for structure prediction and for gaining insights into structure-function relationships.},

@article{Rivas2011,
abstract = {The standard approach for single-sequence RNA secondary structure prediction uses a nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model with several thousand experimentally determined energy parameters. An attractive alternative is to use statistical approaches with parameters estimated from growing databases of structural RNAs. Good results have been reported for discriminative statistical methods using complex nearest-neighbor models, including CONTRAfold, Simfold, and ContextFold. Little work has been reported on generative probabilistic models (stochastic context-free grammars [SCFGs]) of comparable complexity, although probabilistic models are generally easier to train and to use. To explore a range of probabilistic models of increasing complexity, and to directly compare probabilistic, thermodynamic, and discriminative approaches, we created TORNADO, a computational tool that can parse a wide spectrum of RNA grammar architectures (including the standard nearest-neighbor model and more) using a generalized super-grammar that can be parameterized with probabilities, energies, or arbitrary scores. By using TORNADO, we find that probabilistic nearest-neighbor models perform comparably to (but not significantly better than) discriminative methods. We find that complex statistical models are prone to overfitting RNA structure and that evaluations should use structurally nonhomologous training and test data sets. Overfitting has affected at least one published method (ContextFold). The most important barrier to improving statistical approaches for RNA secondary structure prediction is the lack of diversity of well-curated single-sequence RNA secondary structures in current RNA databases.},

@article{Sarver2008a,
abstract = {New methods are described for finding recurrent three-dimensional (3D) motifs in RNA atomic-resolution structures. Recurrent RNA 3D motifs are sets of RNA nucleotides with similar spatial arrangements. They can be local or composite. Local motifs comprise nucleotides that occur in the same hairpin or internal loop. Composite motifs comprise nucleotides belonging to three or more different RNA strand segments or molecules. We use a base-centered approach to construct efficient, yet exhaustive search procedures using geometric, symbolic, or mixed representations of RNA structure that we implement in a suite of MATLAB programs, "Find RNA 3D" (FR3D). The first modules of FR3D preprocess structure files to classify base-pair and -stacking interactions. Each base is represented geometrically by the position of its glycosidic nitrogen in 3D space and by the rotation matrix that describes its orientation with respect to a common frame. Base-pairing and base-stacking interactions are calculated from the base geometries and are represented symbolically according to the Leontis/Westhof basepairing classification, extended to include base-stacking. These data are stored and used to organize motif searches. For geometric searches, the user supplies the 3D structure of a query motif which FR3D uses to find and score geometrically similar candidate motifs, without regard to the sequential position of their nucleotides in the RNA chain or the identity of their bases. To score and rank candidate motifs, FR3D calculates a geometric discrepancy by rigidly rotating candidates to align optimally with the query motif and then comparing the relative orientations of the corresponding bases in the query and candidate motifs. Given the growing size of the RNA structure database, it is impossible to explicitly compute the discrepancy for all conceivable candidate motifs, even for motifs with less than ten nucleotides. The screening algorithm that we describe finds all candidate motifs whose geometric discrepancy with respect to the query motif falls below a user-specified cutoff discrepancy. This technique can be applied to RMSD searches. Candidate motifs identified geometrically may be further screened symbolically to identify those that contain particular basepair types or base-stacking arrangements or that conform to sequence continuity or nucleotide identity constraints. Purely symbolic searches for motifs containing user-defined sequence, continuity and interaction constraints have also been implemented. We demonstrate that FR3D finds all occurrences, both local and composite and with nucleotide substitutions, of sarcin/ricin and kink-turn motifs in the 23S and 5S ribosomal RNA 3D structures of the H. marismortui 50S ribosomal subunit and assigns the lowest discrepancy scores to bona fide examples of these motifs. The search algorithms have been optimized for speed to allow users to search the non-redundant RNA 3D structure database on a personal computer in a matter of minutes.},

abstract = {RNA-templated RNA replication is essential for viral or viroid infection, as well as for regulation of cellular gene expression. Specific RNA motifs likely regulate various aspects of this replication. Viroids of the Pospiviroidae family, as represented by the Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), replicate in the nucleus by utilizing DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II. We investigated the role of the loop E (sarcin/ricin) motif of the PSTVd genomic RNA in replication. A tertiary-structural model of this motif, inferred by comparative sequence analysis and comparison with nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystal structures of loop E motifs in other RNAs, is presented in which core non-Watson-Crick base pairs are precisely specified. Isostericity matrix analysis of these base pairs showed that the model accounts for the reported natural sequence variations and viable experimental mutations in loop E motifs of PSTVd and other viroids. Furthermore, isostericity matrix analysis allowed us to design disruptive, as well as compensatory, mutations of PSTVd loop E. Functional analyses of such mutants by in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that loop E structural integrity is crucial for replication, specifically during transcription. Our results suggest that the PSTVd loop E motif exists and functions in vivo and provide loss-of-function genetic evidence for the essential role of a viroid RNA three-dimensional motif in rolling-circle replication. The use of isostericity matrix analysis of non-Watson-Crick base pairing to rationalize mutagenesis of tertiary motifs and systematic in vitro and in vivo functional assays of mutants offers a novel, comprehensive approach to elucidate the tertiary-structure-function relationships for RNA motifs of general biological significance.},

@article{Leontis2002b,
abstract = {The traditional way to infer RNA secondary structure involves an iterative process of alignment and evaluation of covariation statistics between all positions possibly involved in basepairing. Watson-Crick basepairs typically show covariations that score well when examples of two or more possible basepairs occur. This is not necessarily the case for non-Watson-Crick basepairing geometries. For example, for sheared (trans Hoogsteen/Sugar edge) pairs, one base is highly conserved (always A or mostly A with some C or U), while the other can vary (G or A and sometimes C and U as well). RNA motifs consist of ordered, stacked arrays of non-Watson-Crick basepairs that in the secondary structure representation form hairpin or internal loops, multi-stem junctions, and even pseudoknots. Although RNA motifs occur recurrently and contribute in a modular fashion to RNA architecture, it is usually not apparent which bases interact and whether it is by edge-to-edge H-bonding or solely by stacking interactions. Using a modular sequence-analysis approach, recurrent motifs related to the sarcin-ricin loop of 23S RNA and to loop E from 5S RNA were predicted in universally conserved regions of the large ribosomal RNAs (16S- and 23S-like) before the publication of high-resolution, atomic-level structures of representative examples of 16S and 23S rRNA molecules in their native contexts. This provides the opportunity to evaluate the predictive power of motif-level sequence analysis, with the goal of automating the process for predicting RNA motifs in genomic sequences. The process of inferring structure from sequence by constructing accurate alignments is a circular one. The crucial link that allows a productive iteration of motif modeling and realignment is the comparison of the sequence variations for each putative pair with the corresponding isostericity matrix to determine which basepairs are consistent both with the sequence and the geometrical data.},

abstract = {Specific recognitions of GNRA tetraloops by small helical receptors are among the most widespread long-range packing interactions in large ribozymes. However, in contrast to GYRA and GAAA tetraloops, very few GNRA/receptor interactions have yet been identified to involve GGAA tetraloops in nature. A novel in vitro selection scheme based on a rigid self-assembling tectoRNA scaffold designed for isolation of intermolecular interactions with A-minor motifs has yielded new GGAA tetraloop-binding receptors with affinity in the nanomolar range. One of the selected receptors is a novel 12 nt RNA motif, (CCUGUG ... AUCUGG), that recognizes GGAA tetraloop hairpin with a remarkable specificity and affinity. Its physical and chemical characteristics are comparable to those of the well-studied '11nt' GAAA tetraloop receptor motif. A second less specific motif (CCCAGCCC ... GAUAGGG) binds GGRA tetraloops and appears to be related to group IC3 tetraloop receptors. Mutational, thermodynamic and comparative structural analysis suggests that natural and in vitro selected GNRA receptors can essentially be grouped in two major classes of GNRA binders. New insights about the evolution, recognition and structural modularity of GNRA and A-minor RNA-RNA interactions are proposed.},

The RRMSD probability distribution between random polypeptides converges to a universal curve as the chain length increases. The correlation coefficients between aligned random structures are computed as a function of polypeptide size showing two characteristic lengths of 4.7 and 37 residues. These lengths mark the separation between phases of different structural order between native protein fragments. The implications for threading are discussed.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm to generate complete evolutionary profiles that represent the topology of the molecular phylogenetic tree of the homologous group. The method, based on the multidimensional QR factorization of numerically encoded multiple sequence alignments, removes redundancy from the alignments and orders the protein sequences by increasing linear dependence, resulting in the identification of a minimal basis set of sequences that spans the evolutionary space of the homologous group of proteins. We observe a general trend that these smaller, more evolutionarily balanced profiles have comparable and, in many cases, better performance in database searches than conventional profiles containing hundreds of sequences, constructed in an iterative and computationally intensive procedure. For more diverse families or superfamilies, with sequence identity <30\%, structural alignments, based purely on the geometry of the protein structures, provide better alignments than pure sequence-based methods. Merging the structure and sequence information allows the construction of accurate profiles for distantly related groups. These structure-based profiles outperformed other sequence-based methods for finding distant homologs and were used to identify a putative class II cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS) in several archaea that eluded previous annotation studies. Phylogenetic analysis showed the putative class II CysRSs to be a monophyletic group and homology modeling revealed a constellation of active site residues similar to that in the known class I CysRS.},

These large ribozymes remain important for gene expression in almost all forms of bacteria and eukaryotes and they are believed to share a common ancestry with the eukaryotic spliceosome that is required for processing all nuclear pre-mRNAs. The three-dimensional structure of a group IIC intron was recently determined by X-ray crystallography, making it possible to visualize the active site and the elaborate network of tertiary interactions that stabilize the molecule. Here we describe the molecular features of the active site in detail and evaluate their correspondence with prior biochemical, genetic, and phylogenetic analyses on group II introns. In addition, we evaluate the structural significance of RNA motifs within the intron core, such as the major-groove triple helix and the domain 5 bulge. Having combined what is known about the group II intron core, we then compare it with known structural features of U6 snRNA in the eukaryotic spliceosome. This analysis leads to a set of predictions for the molecular structure of the spliceosomal active site.},

abstract = {The past four years have seen an explosion in the number of detected RNA transcripts with no apparent protein-coding potential. This has led to speculation that non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) might be as important as proteins in the regulation of vital cellular functions. However, there has been significantly less progress in actually demonstrating the functions of these transcripts. In this article, we review the results of recent experiments that show that transcription of non-protein-coding RNA is far more widespread than was previously anticipated. Although some ncRNAs act as molecular switches that regulate gene expression, the function of many ncRNAs is unknown. New experimental and computational approaches are emerging that will help determine whether these newly identified transcription products are evidence of important new biochemical pathways or are merely 'junk' RNA generated by the cell as a by-product of its functional activities.},

abstract = {Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) is a facile technique for quantitative analysis of RNA secondary structure. In general, low SHAPE signal values indicate Watson-Crick base-pairing, and high values indicate positions that are single-stranded within the RNA structure. However, the relationship of SHAPE signals to structural properties such as non-Watson-Crick base-pairing or stacking has thus far not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we present results of SHAPE experiments performed on several RNAs with published three-dimensional structures. This strategy allows us to analyze the results in terms of correlations between chemical reactivities and structural properties of the respective nucleotide, such as different types of base-pairing, stacking, and phosphate-backbone interactions. We find that the RNA SHAPE signal is strongly correlated with cis-Watson-Crick/Watson-Crick base-pairing and is to a remarkable degree not dependent on other structural properties with the exception of stacking. We subsequently generated probabilistic models that estimate the likelihood that a residue with a given SHAPE score participates in base-pairing. We show that several models that take SHAPE scores of adjacent residues into account perform better in predicting base-pairing compared with individual SHAPE scores. This underscores the context sensitivity of SHAPE and provides a framework for an improved interpretation of the response of RNA to chemical modification.},

abstract = {The growing number of high-resolution crystal structures of large RNA molecules provides much information for understanding the principles of structural organization of these complex molecules. Several in-depth analyses of nucleobase-centered RNA structural motifs and backbone conformations have been published based on this information, including a systematic classification of base pairs by Leontis and Westhof. However, hydrogen bonds involving sugar-phosphate backbone atoms of RNA have not been analyzed systematically until recently, although such hydrogen bonds appear to be common both in local and tertiary interactions. Here we review some backbone structural motifs discussed in the literature and analyze a set of eight high-resolution multi-domain RNA structures. The analyzed RNAs are highly structured: among 5372 nucleotides in this set, 89\% are involved in at least one "long-range" RNA-RNA hydrogen bond, i.e., hydrogen bonds between atoms in the same residue or sequential residues are ignored. These long-range hydrogen bonds frequently use backbone atoms as hydrogen bond acceptors, i.e., OP1, OP2, O2', O3', O4', or O5', or as a donor (2'OH). A surprisingly large number of such hydrogen bonds are found, considering that neither single-stranded nor double-stranded regions will contain such hydrogen bonds unless additional interactions with other residues exist. Among 8327 long-range hydrogen bonds found in this set of structures, 2811, or about one-third, are hydrogen bonds entailing RNA backbone atoms; they involve 39\% of all nucleotides in the structures. The majority of them (2111) are hydrogen bonds entailing ribose hydroxyl groups, which can be used either as a donor or an acceptor; they constitute 25\% of all hydrogen bonds and involve 31\% of all nucleotides. The phosphate oxygens OP1 or OP2 are used as hydrogen bond acceptors in 12\% of all nucleotides, and the ribose ring oxygen O4' and phosphodiester oxygens O3' and O5' are used in 4\%, 4\%, and 1\% of all nucleotides, respectively. Distributions of geometric parameters and some examples of such hydrogen bonds are presented in this report. A novel motif involving backbone hydrogen bonds, the ribose-phosphate zipper, is also identified.},

The cytotoxins alpha-sarcin and ricin both inactivate ribosomes by cleaving a single bond in that loop. Once it has been attacked, ribosomes no longer interact with elongation factors properly, and translation stops. We have determined the conformation of the sarcin/ricin loop by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy using E73, a 29-nucleotide RNA that has the sarcin/ricin loop sequence and that is sensitive to both toxins in vitro. The sarcin/ricin loop has a compact structure that contains several purine.purine base pairs, a GAGA tetraloop, and a bulged guanosine adjacent to a reverse Hoogsteen A.U pair. It is stabilized by an unusual set of cross-strand base-stacking interactions and imino proton to phosphate oxygen hydrogen bonds. In addition to having interesting structural features, this model explains many of the biochemical observations made about the loop's structure and its reactivity with cytotoxins, and it sheds light on the loop's interactions with elongation factors.},

abstract = {Computational methods for determining the secondary structure of RNA sequences from given alignments are currently either based on thermodynamic folding, compensatory base pair substitutions or both. However, there is currently no approach that combines both sources of information in a single optimization problem. Here, we present a model that formally integrates both the energy-based and evolution-based approaches to predict the folding of multiple aligned RNA sequences. We have implemented an extended version of Pfold that identifies base pairs that have high probabilities of being conserved and of being energetically favorable. The consensus structure is predicted using a maximum expected accuracy scoring scheme to smoothen the effect of incorrectly predicted base pairs. Parameter tuning revealed that the probability of base pairing has a higher impact on the RNA structure prediction than the corresponding probability of being single stranded. Furthermore, we found that structurally conserved RNA motifs are mostly supported by folding energies. Other problems (e.g. RNA-folding kinetics) may also benefit from employing the principles of the model we introduce. Our implementation, PETfold, was tested on a set of 46 well-curated Rfam families and its performance compared favorably to that of Pfold and RNAalifold.},

@article{Ogle2005,
abstract = {The underlying basis for the accuracy of protein synthesis has been the subject of over four decades of investigation. Recent biochemical and structural data make it possible to understand at least in outline the structural basis for tRNA selection, in which codon recognition by cognate tRNA results in the hydrolysis of GTP by EF-Tu over 75 A away. The ribosome recognizes the geometry of codon-anticodon base pairing at the first two positions but monitors the third, or wobble position, less stringently. Part of the additional binding energy of cognate tRNA is used to induce conformational changes in the ribosome that stabilize a transition state for GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu and subsequently result in accelerated accommodation of tRNA into the peptidyl transferase center. The transition state for GTP hydrolysis is characterized, among other things, by a distorted tRNA. This picture explains a large body of data on the effect of antibiotics and mutations on translational fidelity. However, many fundamental questions remain, such as the mechanism of activation of GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu, and the relationship between decoding and frameshifting.},

abstract = {Kink-turns (K-turns) are common structural motifs that can introduce sharp kinks into double-stranded RNA, and have been proposed to mediate large-scale motions in the ribosome. K-turns consist of a bulge loop region flanked by trans sugar-Hoogsteen G:A pairs, and the sharp kink conformation is stabilized by A-minor interactions (adenine contacting a G:C basepair in the minor groove). Umbrella-sampling molecular dynamics simulations were used to disrupt an A-minor interaction in the ribosomal kt38 turn and to calculate the associated free-energy change. Coupling of umbrella sampling with replica exchanges between neighboring umbrella-sampling intervals could further improve the convergence of the free-energy calculations. The simulations revealed a coupled A-minor disruption and global opening of the K-turn motif, and allowed us to characterize several intermediate A-minor conformations. The calculated free-energy profile indicated a meta-stable, semi-open structure of slightly higher free energy ( approximately 1 kcal mol(-1)), separated by a small free-energy barrier ( approximately 1.5 kcal mol(-1)) from the closed (highly kinked) form. Both K-turn states are stabilized by distinct variants of the A-minor interaction. Further opening of the K-turn structure required significantly larger free-energy changes. The semi-open form had a reduced kink angle compatible with experimental data on K-turn solution structures, and opening was coupled to a continuous global unwinding of the K-turn motif. The range of free-energy changes associated with kt38 opening and unwinding are compatible with the idea that K-turns may facilitate biologically relevant motions during large-scale ribosome dynamics.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that RNA structural motifs play essential roles in RNA folding and interaction with other molecules. Computational identification and analysis of RNA structural motifs remains a challenging task. Existing motif identification methods based on 3D structure may not properly compare motifs with high structural variations. Other structural motif identification methods consider only nested canonical base-pairing structures and cannot be used to identify complex RNA structural motifs that often consist of various non-canonical base pairs due to uncommon hydrogen bond interactions. In this article, we present a novel RNA structural alignment method for RNA structural motif identification, RNAMotifScan, which takes into consideration the isosteric (both canonical and non-canonical) base pairs and multi-pairings in RNA structural motifs. The utility and accuracy of RNAMotifScan is demonstrated by searching for kink-turn, C-loop, sarcin-ricin, reverse kink-turn and E-loop motifs against a 23S rRNA (PDBid: 1S72), which is well characterized for the occurrences of these motifs. Finally, we search these motifs against the RNA structures in the entire Protein Data Bank and the abundances of them are estimated. RNAMotifScan is freely available at our supplementary website (http://genome.ucf.edu/RNAMotifScan).},

abstract = {Bacterial genomes encode a plethora of small RNAs (sRNAs), which are heterogeneous in size, structure and function. Most sRNAs act as post-transcriptional regulators by means of specific base pairing interactions with the 5'-untranslated region of mRNA transcripts, thereby modifying the stability of the target transcript and/or its ability to be translated. Here, we present RNApredator, a web server for the prediction of sRNA targets. The user can choose from a set of over 2155 genomes and plasmids from 1183 bacterial species. RNApredator then uses a dynamic programming approach, RNAplex, to compute putative targets. Compared to web servers with a similar task, RNApredator takes the accessibility of the target during the target search into account, improving the specificity of the predictions. Furthermore, enrichment in Gene Ontology terms, cellular pathways as well as changes in accessibilities along the target sequence can be done in fully automated post-processing steps. The predictive performance of the underlying dynamic programming approach RNAplex is similar to that of more complex methods, but needs at least three orders of magnitude less time to complete.

The SRL includes a long, conserved sequence found in the RNA of all large ribosomal subunits, which plays a critical role in the factor-dependent steps of protein synthesis. The spectroscopic observations and analysis that led to the determination of the conformation of E73 are presented. The SRL in E73 has a highly structured conformation, which is stabilized by several non-Watson-Crick base-pairs, and many properties of the SRL in the ribosome can be understood assuming that the conformation of E73 and that of the SRL in the ribosome are the same. The role of the SRL in protein synthesis is discussed in light of the conformation of E73, as is the modular relationship that exists between the conformation of the SRL and other smaller RNAs.},

Binding specificities of C-loop-containing molecules for cognate molecules that also have inserted C-loops were found to range up to 20-fold. Binding affinities for most C-loop-containing molecules were generally equal or higher than those for the parent molecules lacking C-loops.},

abstract = {K-turn motifs are universal RNA structural elements providing a binding platform for proteins in several cellular contexts. Their characteristic is a sharp kink in the phosphate backbone that puts the two helical stems of the protein-bound RNA at an angle of 60°. However, to date no high-resolution structure of a naked K-turn motif is available. Here, we present the first structural investigation at atomic resolution of an unbound K-turn RNA (the spliceosomal U4-Kt RNA) by a combination of NMR and small-angle neutron scattering data. With this study, we wish to address the question whether the K-turn structural motif assumes the sharply kinked conformation in the absence of protein binders and divalent cations. Previous studies have addressed this question by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, biochemical assays and molecular dynamics simulations, suggesting that the K-turn RNAs exist in equilibrium between a kinked conformation, which is competent for protein binding, and a more extended conformation, with the population distribution depending on the concentration of divalent cations. Our data shows that the U4-Kt RNA predominantly assumes the more extended conformation in the absence of proteins and divalent cations. The internal loop region is well structured but adopts a different conformation from the one observed in complex with proteins. Our data suggests that the K-turn consensus sequence does not per se code for the kinked conformation; instead the sharp backbone kink requires to be stabilized by protein binders.},

abstract = {Non-Watson-Crick base pairs mediate specific interactions responsible for RNA-RNA self-assembly and RNA-protein recognition. An unambiguous and descriptive nomenclature with well-defined and nonoverlapping parameters is needed to communicate concisely structural information about RNA base pairs. The definitions should reflect underlying molecular structures and interactions and, thus, facilitate automated annotation, classification, and comparison of new RNA structures. We propose a classification based on the observation that the planar edge-to-edge, hydrogen-bonding interactions between RNA bases involve one of three distinct edges: the Watson-Crick edge, the Hoogsteen edge, and the Sugar edge (which includes the 2'-OH and which has also been referred to as the Shallow-groove edge). Bases can interact in either of two orientations with respect to the glycosidic bonds, cis or trans relative to the hydrogen bonds. This gives rise to 12 basic geometric types with at least two H bonds connecting the bases. For each geometric type, the relative orientations of the strands can be easily deduced. High-resolution examples of 11 of the 12 geometries are presently available. Bifurcated pairs, in which a single exocyclic carbonyl or amino group of one base directly contacts the edge of a second base, and water-inserted pairs, in which single functional groups on each base interact directly, are intermediate between two of the standard geometries. The nomenclature facilitates the recognition of isosteric relationships among base pairs within each geometry, and thus facilitates the recognition of recurrent three-dimensional motifs from comparison of homologous sequences. Graphical conventions are proposed for displaying non-Watson-Crick interactions on a secondary structure diagram. The utility of the classification in homology modeling of RNA tertiary motifs is illustrated.},

abstract = {Computational methods for predicting evolutionarily conserved rather than thermodynamic RNA structures have recently attracted increased interest. These methods are indispensable not only for elucidating the regulatory roles of known RNA transcripts, but also for predicting RNA genes. It has been notoriously difficult to devise them to make the best use of the available data and to predict high-quality RNA structures that may also contain pseudoknots. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for co-estimating an RNA secondary structure including pseudoknots, a multiple sequence alignment, and an evolutionary tree, given several RNA input sequences. We also present an implementation of the framework in a new computer program, called SimulFold, which employs a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method to sample from the joint posterior distribution of RNA structures, alignments, and trees. We use the new framework to predict RNA structures, and comprehensively evaluate the quality of our predictions by comparing our results to those of several other programs. We also present preliminary data that show SimulFold's potential as an alignment and phylogeny prediction method. SimulFold overcomes many conceptual limitations that current RNA structure prediction methods face, introduces several new theoretical techniques, and generates high-quality predictions of conserved RNA structures that may include pseudoknots. It is thus likely to have a strong impact, both on the field of RNA structure prediction and on a wide range of data analyses.},

abstract = {The kink turn (K-turn) is a common motif in RNA structure, found in many RNA species important in translation, RNA modification and splicing, and the control of gene expression. In general the K-turn comprises a three nucleotide bulge followed by trans sugar-Hoogsteen G.A pairs. The RNA adopts a tightly kinked conformation, and is a common target for binding proteins, exemplified by the L7Ae family. We have measured the rates of association and dissociation for the binding of L7Ae to the Kt-7 kink turn, from which we calculate an affinity of K(D)=10 pM. This high affinity is consistent with the role of this binding as the first stage in the assembly of key functional nucleoproteins such as box C/D snoRNP. Kink-turn RNA undergoes a two-state transition between the kinked conformation, and a more extended structure, and folding into the kinked form is induced by divalent metal ions, or by binding of proteins of the L7Ae class. The K-turn provides an excellent, simple model for RNA folding, which can be dissected at the atomic level. We have analyzed the contributions of the hydrogen bonds that form the G.A pairs to the ion- and protein-induced folding of the K-turn. We find that all four hydrogen bonds are important to the stability of the kinked form of the RNA, and we can now define all the important hydrogen bonding interactions that stabilize the K-turn. The high affinity of L7Ae binding is coupled to the induced folding of the K-turn, allowing some sub-optimal variants to adopt the kinked geometry. However, in all such cases the affinity is lowered, and the results underline the importance of both G.A pairs to the stability of the K-turn.},

abstract = {RNA is a large group of functionally important biomacromolecules. In striking analogy to proteins, the function of RNA depends on its structure and dynamics, which in turn is encoded in the linear sequence. However, while there are numerous methods for computational prediction of protein three-dimensional (3D) structure from sequence, with comparative modeling being the most reliable approach, there are very few such methods for RNA. Here, we present ModeRNA, a software tool for comparative modeling of RNA 3D structures. As an input, ModeRNA requires a 3D structure of a template RNA molecule, and a sequence alignment between the target to be modeled and the template. It must be emphasized that a good alignment is required for successful modeling, and for large and complex RNA molecules the development of a good alignment usually requires manual adjustments of the input data based on previous expertise of the respective RNA family. ModeRNA can model post-transcriptional modifications, a functionally important feature analogous to post-translational modifications in proteins. ModeRNA can also model DNA structures or use them as templates. It is equipped with many functions for merging fragments of different nucleic acid structures into a single model and analyzing their geometry. Windows and UNIX implementations of ModeRNA with comprehensive documentation and a tutorial are freely available.},

abstract = {RNA tertiary structure prediction has been based almost entirely on base-pairing constraints derived from phylogenetic covariation analysis. We describe here a complementary approach, inspired by the Rosetta low-resolution protein structure prediction method, that seeks the lowest energy tertiary structure for a given RNA sequence without using evolutionary information. In a benchmark test of 20 RNA sequences with known structure and lengths of approximately 30 nt, the new method reproduces better than 90\% of Watson-Crick base pairs, comparable with the accuracy of secondary structure prediction methods. In more than half the cases, at least one of the top five models agrees with the native structure to better than 4 A rmsd over the backbone. Most importantly, the method recapitulates more than one-third of non-Watson-Crick base pairs seen in the native structures. Tandem stacks of "sheared" base pairs, base triplets, and pseudoknots are among the noncanonical features reproduced in the models. In the cases in which none of the top five models were native-like, higher energy conformations similar to the native structures are still sampled frequently but not assigned low energies. These results suggest that modest improvements in the energy function, together with the incorporation of information from phylogenetic covariance, may allow confident and accurate structure prediction for larger and more complex RNA chains.},

We detected clear evidence of the hallmark of homology present in the sequence-structure relationships in loops. Loops differing by <25\% in sequence identity fold into very similar structures. Thus, our results support the application of homology modeling for RNA loop model building. We established a threshold that may guide the sequence divergence-based selection of template structures for RNA loop homology modeling. Of all possible sequences that are, under the assumption of isosteric relationships, theoretically compatible with actual sequences observed in RNA structures, only a small fraction is contained in the Rfam database of RNA sequences and classes implying that the actual RNA loop space may consist of a limited number of unique loop structures and conserved sequences. The loop-structure data sets are made available via an online database, RLooM.

abstract = {Non-canonical base pairs, mostly present in the RNA, often play a prominent role towards maintaining their structural diversity. Higher order structures like base triples are also important in defining and stabilizing the tertiary folded structure of RNA. We have developed a new program BPFIND to analyze different types of canonical and non-canonical base pairs and base triples involving at least two direct hydrogen bonds formed between polar atoms of the bases or sugar O2' only. We considered 104 possible types of base pairs, out of which examples of 87 base pair types are found to occur in the available RNA crystal structures. Analysis indicates that approximately 32.7\% base pairs in the functional RNA structures are non-canonical, which include different types of GA and GU Wobble base pairs apart from a wide range of base pair possibilities. We further noticed that more than 10.4\% of these base pairs are involved in triplet formation, most of which play important role in maintaining long-range tertiary contacts in the three-dimensional folded structure of RNA. Apart from detection, the program also gives a quantitative estimate of the conformational deformation of detected base pairs in comparison to an ideal planar base pair. This helps us to gain insight into the extent of their structural variations and thus assists in understanding their specific role towards structural and functional diversity.},

abstract = {It has long been accepted that the structural constraints stemming from the 3D structure of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) lead to coevolution through compensating mutations between interacting sites. State-of-the-art methods for detecting coevolving sites, however, while reaching high levels of specificity and sensitivity for Watson-Crick (WC) pairs of the helices defining the secondary structure, only scarcely reveal tertiary interactions occurring at the level of the 3D structure. In order to understand the relative failure of coevolutionary methods to detect such interactions, we analyze 2,682 interacting sites derived from high-resolution structures, which include a comprehensive data set of rRNA sequences from Archaea and Bacteria. We report a striking difference in the amount of coevolution between WC and non-WC pairs. In order to understand this pattern, we derive fitness landscapes from the geometry of base pairing interactions and construct neutral networks of substitutions for each type of interaction. These networks show that coevolution is a property of WC pairs because, unlike non-WC pairs, their landscapes exhibit fitness valleys, a single mutation in a WC pair resulting in a fitness drop. Second, we used the inferred neutral networks to estimate the level of constraint acting on each type of base pair and show that it correlates negatively with the observed rate of substitutions for all non-WC pairs. WC pairs appear as outliers, fixing more substitutions than expected according to their level of constraint. We here propose that the rate of substitution in WC pairs is due to coevolution resulting from constraints acting at intermediate levels of organization, namely the one of the helical stem with its forming WC pairs. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report a significant excess of intrahelical, inter-WC pairs coevolution compared with interhelices pairs. Altogether, these results show that detailed biochemical knowledge is required and has to be incorporated into evolutionary reasoning in order to understand the fine patterns of variation at the molecular level. They also demonstrate that coevolutionary analysis provides almost exclusively 2D information and only little 3D signal.},

Microbial community characterization using small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) gene sequences has revealed an extensive, previously unsuspected diversity that we are only now beginning to understand, especially now that advanced sequencing technologies are producing datasets containing hundreds of thousands of sequences from hundreds of samples. Efforts to quantify microbial diversity often use taxon-based methods that ignore the fact that not all species are equally related, which can therefore obscure important patterns in the data. For example, alpha-diversity (diversity within communities) is often estimated as the number of species in a community (species richness), and beta-diversity (partitioning of diversity among communities) is often based on the number of shared species. Methods for measuring alpha- and beta-diversity that account for different levels of divergence between individuals have recently been more widely applied. These methods are more powerful than taxon-based methods because microorganisms in a community differ dramatically in sequence similarity, which also often correlates with phenotypic similarity in key features such as metabolic capabilities. Consequently, divergence-based methods are providing new insights into microbial community structure and function.},

One current view asserts that recurrent RNA strand segments with characteristic backbone configurations qualify as independent motifs. Other considerations indicate that, to characterize modular motifs, one must take into account the larger structural context of such strand segments.

abstract = {Based on comparative genomics, we created a bioinformatic package for computer prediction of small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes in mammalian introns. The core of our approach was the use of the Mammalian Orthologous Intron Database (MOID), which contains all known introns within the human, mouse and rat genomes. Introns from orthologous genes from these three species, that have the same position relative to the reading frame, are grouped in a special orthologous intron table. Our program SNO.pl searches for conserved snoRNA motifs within MOID and reports all cases when characteristic snoRNA-like structures are present in all three orthologous introns of human, mouse and rat sequences. Here we report an example of the SNO.pl usage for searching a particular pattern of conserved C/D-box snoRNA motifs (canonical C- and D-boxes and the 6 nt long terminal stem). In this computer analysis, we detected 57 triplets of snoRNA-like structures in three mammals. Among them were 15 triplets that represented known C/D-box snoRNA genes. Six triplets represented snoRNA genes that had only been partially characterized in the mouse genome. One case represented a novel snoRNA gene, and another three cases, putative snoRNAs. Our programs are publicly available and can be easily adapted and/or modified for searching any conserved motifs within mammalian introns.},

The new version represents the classification as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which allows a classification node to have multiple parents, in contrast to the strictly hierarchical classification used in SCOR 1.2. SCOR 2.0 supports three types of query terms in the updated search engine: PDB or NDB identifier, nucleotide sequence and keyword. We also provide parseable XML files for all information. This new release contains 511 RNA entries from the PDB as of 15 May 2003. A total of 5880 secondary structural elements are classified: 2104 hairpin loops and 3776 internal loops. RNA motifs reported in the literature, such as 'Kink turn' and 'GNRA loops', are now incorporated into the structural classification along with definitions and descriptions.},

abstract = {The human 15.5K protein binds to the 5' stem-loop of U4 snRNA, promotes the assembly of the spliceosomal U4/U6 snRNP, and is required for the recruitment of the 61K protein and the 20/60/90K protein complex to the U4 snRNA. In the crystallographic structure of the 15.5K-U4 snRNA complex, the conformation of the RNA corresponds to the family of kink-turn (K-turn) structural motifs. We simulated the complex and the free RNA, showing how the protein binding and the intrinsic flexibility contribute to the RNA folding process. We found that the RNA is significantly more flexible in the absence of the 15.5K protein. Conformational transitions such as the interconversion between alternative purine stacking schemes, the loss of G-A base pairs, and the opening of the K-turn occur only in the free RNA. Furthermore, the stability of one canonical G-C base pair is influenced both by the binding of the 15.5K protein and the nature of the adjacent structural element in the RNA. We performed chemical RNA modification experiments and observed that the free RNA lacks secondary structure elements, a result in excellent agreement with the simulations. Based on these observations, we propose a protein-assisted RNA folding mechanism in which the RNA intrinsic flexibility functions as a catalyst.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that RNA structural motifs play essential roles in RNA folding and interaction with other molecules. Computational identification and analysis of RNA structural motifs remains a challenging task. Existing motif identification methods based on 3D structure may not properly compare motifs with high structural variations. Other structural motif identification methods consider only nested canonical base-pairing structures and cannot be used to identify complex RNA structural motifs that often consist of various non-canonical base pairs due to uncommon hydrogen bond interactions. In this article, we present a novel RNA structural alignment method for RNA structural motif identification, RNAMotifScan, which takes into consideration the isosteric (both canonical and non-canonical) base pairs and multi-pairings in RNA structural motifs. The utility and accuracy of RNAMotifScan is demonstrated by searching for kink-turn, C-loop, sarcin-ricin, reverse kink-turn and E-loop motifs against a 23S rRNA (PDBid: 1S72), which is well characterized for the occurrences of these motifs. Finally, we search these motifs against the RNA structures in the entire Protein Data Bank and the abundances of them are estimated. RNAMotifScan is freely available at our supplementary website (http://genome.ucf.edu/RNAMotifScan).},

abstract = {Non-canonical base pairs contribute immensely to the structural and functional variability of RNA, which calls for a detailed characterization of their spatial conformation. Intra-base pair parameters, namely propeller, buckle, open-angle, stagger, shear and stretch describe structure of base pairs indicating planarity and proximity of association between the two bases. In order to study the conformational specificities of non-canonical base pairs occurring in RNA crystal structures, we have upgraded NUPARM software to calculate these intra-base pair parameters using a new base pairing edge specific axis system. Analysis of base pairs and base triples with the new edge specific axis system indicate the presence of specific structural signatures for different classes of non-canonical pairs and triples. Differentiating features could be identified for pairs in cis or trans orientation, as well as those involving sugar edges or C-H-mediated hydrogen bonds. It was seen that propeller for all types of base pairs in cis orientation are generally negative, while those for trans base pairs do not have any preference. Formation of a base triple is seen to reduce propeller of the associated base pair along with reduction of overall flexibility of the pairs. We noticed that base pairs involving sugar edge are generally more non-planar, with large propeller or buckle values, presumably to avoid steric clash between the bulky sugar moieties. These specific conformational signatures often provide an insight into their role in the structural and functional context of RNA.},

The bottom part of this molecule consists of alternating rigid and flexible segments. The first flexible segment (Hinge1) is the highly anharmonic kink of Kt-42. The second one (Hinge2) is localized at the junction between helix 42 and helices 43/44. The rigid segments are the two arms of helix 42 flanking the kink. The whole molecule ends up with compact helices 43/44 (Head) which appear to be modestly compressed towards the subunit in the Haloarcula marismortui X-ray structure. Overall, the helix 42-44 rRNA is constructed as a sophisticated intrinsically flexible anisotropic molecular limb. The leading flexibility modes include bending at the hinges and twisting. The Head shows visible internal conformational plasticity, stemming from an intricate set of base pairing patterns including dynamical triads and tetrads. In summary, we demonstrate how rRNA building blocks with contrasting intrinsic flexibilities can form larger architectures with highly specific patterns of preferred low-energy motions and geometries.},

Generally, the average root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) are quoted. However, RMSD can be misleading since errors are spread over the whole molecule and do not account for the specificity of RNA base interactions. Here, we introduce two new metrics that are particularly suitable to RNAs: the deformation index and deformation profile. The deformation index is calibrated by the interaction network fidelity, which considers base-base-stacking and base-base-pairing interactions within the target structure. The deformation profile highlights dissimilarities between structures at the nucleotide scale for both intradomain and interdomain interactions. Our results show that there is little correlation between RMSD and interaction network fidelity. The deformation profile is a tool that allows for rapid assessment of the origins of discrepancies.},

abstract = {The kink-turn (k-turn), a new RNA structural motif found in the spliceosome and the ribosome, serves as a specific protein recognition element and as a structural building block. While the structure of the spliceosomal U4 snRNA k-turn/15.5K complex is known from a crystal structure, it is unclear whether the k-turn also exists in this folded conformation in the free U4 snRNA. Thus, we investigated the U4 snRNA k-turn by single-molecule FRET measurements in the absence and presence of the 15.5K protein and its dependence on the Na(+) and Mg(2+) ion concentration. We show that the unfolded U4 snRNA k-turn introduces a kink of 85 degrees +/- 15 degrees in an RNA double helix. While Na(+) and Mg(2+) ions induce this more open conformation of the k-turn, binding of the 15.5K protein was found to induce the tightly kinked conformation in the RNA that increases the kink to 52 degrees +/- 15 degrees . By comparison of the measured FRET distances with a computer-modeled structure, we show that this strong kink is due to the k-turn motif adopting its folded conformation. Thus, in the free U4 snRNA, the k-turn exists only in an unfolded conformation, and its folding is induced by binding of the 15.5K protein.},

@article{Nolivos2005,
abstract = {The C/D guide RNAs predicted from the genomic sequences of three species of Pyrococcus delineate a family of small non-coding archaeal RNAs involved in the methylation of rRNA and tRNA. The C/D guides assemble into ribonucleoprotein (RNP) that contains the methyltransferase. The protein L7Ae, a key structural component of the RNP, binds to a Kink-turn (K-turn) formed by the C/D motif. The K-turn is a structure that consists of two RNA stems separated by a short asymmetric loop with a characteristic sharp bend (kink) between the two stems. The majority of the pyrococcal C/D guides contain a short 3 nt-spacer between the C'/D' motifs. We show here that conserved terminal stem-loops formed by the C'/D' motif of the Pyrococcus C/D RNAs are also L7Ae-binding sites. These stem-loops are related to the K-turn by sequence and structure, but they consist of a single stem closed by a terminal loop. We have named this structure the K-loop. We show that conserved non-canonical base pairs in the stem of the K-loop are necessary for L7Ae binding. For the C/D guides with a 3 nt-spacer we show that the sequence and length is also important. The K-loop could improve the stability of the C/D guide RNAs in Pyrococcal species, which are extreme hyperthermophiles.},

One of the key remaining challenges is an efficient probabilistic exploration of the structural space that correctly reflects the relative conformational stabilities. Here, we present a fully probabilistic, continuous model of local protein structure in atomic detail. The generative model makes efficient conformational sampling possible and provides a framework for the rigorous analysis of local sequence-structure correlations in the native state. Our method represents a significant theoretical and practical improvement over the widely used fragment assembly technique by avoiding the drawbacks associated with a discrete and nonprobabilistic approach.},

@article{Gevertz2005,
abstract = {In vitro selection of functional RNAs from large random sequence pools has led to the identification of many ligand-binding and catalytic RNAs. However, the structural diversity in random pools is not well understood. Such an understanding is a prerequisite for designing sequence pools to increase the probability of finding complex functional RNA by in vitro selection techniques. Toward this goal, we have generated by computer five random pools of RNA sequences of length up to 100 nt to mimic experiments and characterized the distribution of associated secondary structural motifs using sets of possible RNA tree structures derived from graph theory techniques. Our results show that such random pools heavily favor simple topological structures: For example, linear stem-loop and low-branching motifs are favored rather than complex structures with high-order junctions, as confirmed by known aptamers. Moreover, we quantify the rise of structural complexity with sequence length and report the dominant class of tree motifs (characterized by vertex number) for each pool. These analyses show not only that random pools do not lead to a uniform distribution of possible RNA secondary topologies; they point to avenues for designing pools with specific simple and complex structures in equal abundance in the goal of broadening the range of functional RNAs discovered by in vitro selection. Specifically, the optimal RNA sequence pool length to identify a structure with x stems is 20x.},

abstract = {Kink-turn (K-turn) motifs are asymmetric internal loops found at conserved positions in diverse RNAs, with sharp bends in phosphodiester backbones producing V-shaped structures. Explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for three K-turns from 23S rRNA, i.e., Kt-38 located at the base of the A-site finger, Kt-42 located at the base of the L7/L12 stalk, and Kt-58 located in domain III, and for the K-turn of human U4 snRNA. The simulations reveal hinge-like K-turn motions on the nanosecond timescale. The first conserved A-minor interaction between the K-turn stems is entirely stable in all simulations. The angle between the helical arms of Kt-38 and Kt-42 is regulated by local variations of the second A-minor (type I) interaction between the stems. Its variability ranges from closed geometries to open ones stabilized by insertion of long-residency waters between adenine and cytosine. The simulated A-minor geometries fully agree with x-ray data. Kt-58 and Kt-U4 exhibit similar elbow-like motions caused by conformational change of the adenosine from the nominally unpaired region. Despite the observed substantial dynamics of K-turns, key tertiary interactions are stable and no sign of unfolding is seen. We suggest that some K-turns are flexible elements mediating large-scale ribosomal motions during the protein synthesis cycle.},
